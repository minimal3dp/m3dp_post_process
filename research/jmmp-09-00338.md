Abstract
This study presents a newly developed program that seamlessly converts G-code into
formats compatible with Abaqus, enabling precise finite element simulations for FDM 3D
printing. The tool operates on a two-pronged framework: a mathematical model incor-
porating key print parameters (layer thickness, extrusion temperature, print speed, and
raster width) and a shape generator managing geometric parameters (fill density, pattern,
and raster orientation). Initially, a predefined virtual section, based on predetermined
dimensions, enhanced the correlation between experimental results and simulations. Sub-
sequently, a corrected virtual section, derived from the mathematical model using the
Box–Behnken methodology, improves accuracy, achieving a virtual thickness error of 1.06%
and a width error of 8%. The model is validated through tensile testing of ASTM D638 spec-
imens at 0◦, 45◦, and 90◦orientations, using adaptive C3D4 mesh elements (0.35–0.6 mm).
Results demonstrate that the corrected cross-section significantly improved simulation
accuracy, reaching correlations above 95% in the elastic zone and 90% in the elastoplastic
zone across all orientations. By optimizing the workflow from design to manufacturing,
this program offers substantial benefits for the aerospace, medical, and automotive sectors,
enhancing both the efficiency of the printing process and the reliability of simulations.

1. Introduction
3D printing, sometimes referred also as additive manufacturing (AM), has led to a sub-
stantial change in how we think about manufacturing processes [1–3]. This breakthrough
technique permits the direct fabrication of complex geometries through virtual models [4].
In contrast to typical subtractive manufacturing processes, which require removing ma-
terial to achieve a desired shape, AM creates items layer by layer, enabling unequaled
design freedom and customization possibility [5–8]. This technology has altered several
areas, including aerospace, medicine, and the automobile sector, making it feasible to print
sophisticated components and prototypes with exceptional precision [9,10].
G-code, a programming language developed in the 1950s for computer numerical
control (CNC) machine tools [11,12], plays a critical role in the 3D printing process [13].
It consists of a series of G and M commands that precisely control the movement, speed,

and activities of 3D printers during the fabrication process [14] . In the context of additive
manufacturing, G-code serves as the essential bridge between digital design and physical
production, translating CAD models into machine instructions for layer-by-layer material
deposition [15]. For finite element analysis (FEA) tools like SIMULIA Abaqus [16,17],
G-code provides the critical path information necessary to simulate the actual printing
process, including thermal and mechanical behavior during fabrication [18,19].
Despite its importance, the conversion of G-code to simulation-ready models presents
significant challenges. While Abaqus offers comprehensive tools for modeling various
aspects of the 3D printing process—such as heat transfer, material solidification, stress
analysis, and structural deformation—the accurate representation of the physical printing
process remains difficult [20–22]. The mechanical response of printed specimens is highly
dependent on numerous printing parameters, and G-code itself varies significantly across
different 3D printers and slicing software [14]. This heterogeneity necessitates sophisticated
parsing algorithms capable of extracting meaningful information from diverse G-code di-
alects [23]. As documented by Zouaoui et al. [18] and Brenken et al. [24], current conversion
methods often fail to account for physical filament deformation during printing, resulting
in simulation errors exceeding 15% in stress distribution predictions.
Several studies have attempted to address these challenges. Favaloro et al. [25] em-
ployed Digimat-AM© to simulate FDM processes, while Talagani et al. [26] presented one
of the most advanced studies on Extrusion Deposition Additive Manufacturing (EDAM)
simulations. Their work modeled deformation and residual stresses across an entire fiber-
reinforced thermoplastic car chassis, incorporating progressive element activation and
spatially varying material orientations to capture the inherent anisotropy of printed struc-
tures. Faria et al. [27] developed FIBR3DEmul, an open-access simulation solution for
FDM machines with 3+ actuated axes, while Brenken et al. [24] extended this work by
simulating the Extrusion Deposition Additive Manufacturing (EDAM) process in Abaqus
to predict final deformed geometries and residual stresses. However, these approaches
have limitations: Faria et al.’s [27] method focuses primarily on motion simulation with-
out addressing corrected virtual section for filament deformation, and Brenken et al. [24]
approach lacks comprehensive parameter optimization for virtual raster sections. Sim-
ilarly, Zhang et al. [21] used Abaqus to examine milling temperature in titanium alloys
for aerospace components, but their work did not address the fundamental challenges of
G-code conversion for additive manufacturing simulations.
A critical gap exists in the current literature: no existing method simultaneously
addresses accurate G-code parsing, physical filament deformation correction, and adaptive
mesh generation for FDM simulations. While Molazadeh et al. [28] achieved 77% correlation
between simulation and experimental results using unidirectional deposition without
continuation, their approach did not incorporate corrected virtual section for filament
deformation during the conversion process. Timofeeva et al. [29] emphasized the need
for process simulation systems for small batch production, Zhang et al. [21] used Abaqus
to examine the effect of cutting conditions on milling temperature in aerospace material.
Zouaoui et al. [20] determined the correlation of 85% to 73% between the numerical model
and the tensile test result via the use of a method of reinforcement of a matrix by fibers.
Dallal et al. [30] recently reviewed the orientation-dependent mechanical properties of
high-performance polymers like PEEK, demonstrating how raster orientation significantly
affects ultimate tensile strength (73 MPa at 0◦vs. 54 MPa at 90◦), highlighting the critical
importance of accurate geometric representation in FDM simulations. This limitation
significantly affects the accuracy of stress distribution predictions, particularly in complex
geometries and multi-material prints.

Despite recent advances in G-code parsing and process-aware finite-element models,
two important gaps remain: (1) most conversion workflows use nominal filament cross-
sections that do not reflect extrusion physics and printer settings, producing geometry
errors that degrade simulation fidelity; (2) few tools offer an automated, validated pipeline
from printer G-code to Abaqus with a physically calibrated filament cross-section. To
address these gaps this manuscript proposes a two-module approach: (i) a mathematical
model, calibrated by a Box–Behnken experimental design, to predict a corrected virtual
filament section as a function of printing parameters; and (ii) a shape-generator and
interface that sweeps that corrected section along the G-code toolpath and exports an
Abaqus INP ready for simulation. We validate the workflow by comparing simulations to
tensile experiments on ASTM D638 specimens printed at 0◦, 45◦, and 90◦raster orientations.
The main contributions are:
•
A physically calibrated polynomial model for virtual filament cross-section (Box–
Behnken calibration).
•
A Python-based G-code →Abaqus interface and shape generator that produces mesh-
ready geometry.
•
A validation suite combining SEM and tensile tests to quantify geometry and mechan-
ical fidelity.
These elements together provide an automated, experimentally anchored path from
printer settings to improved FEA predictive capability for FFF parts.
2. Materials and Methods
This section details the methodology for developing and validating a G-code-to-
Abaqus conversion tool. The primary objective is to establish a workflow that accurately
translates physical printing parameters into numerical samples used for simulations with
emphasis on correcting filament cross-section deformation and optimizing mesh generation
for stress analysis. The methodology encompasses four key components: (1) monofila-
ment section analysis (which uses oval-rectangular shape defined by length and height),
experimentally analyzing the effect of printing parameters on these two dimensions using
Box–Behnken experimental design to define the dimension of the virtual section used as
base to create the numerical sample; (2) shape generator that follows the G-code instruc-
tions given the virtual section a path for generating; (3) integration of a fixed mesh to
samples depending on complexities of the component, with mesh size ranging between
0.35 and 0.6 mm; and (4) interface has been added to facilitate communication with the
user. Validation is performed by comparing the geometry of the generated sample in
Abaqus with the slicer-generated geometry and conducting numerical tensile tests using
both corrected and non-corrected section models (based on Hachimi et al.’s [31] approach).
This validation approach confirms the tool’s reliability, enabling direct simulation of similar
samples without requiring additional experimental testing.
Developing and validating a tool code for a 3D printer involves several key steps.
Initially, designing an FDM specimen in CAD software and saving it as an STL file. This STL
file is then sliced along with desired printing parameters, generating G-code instructions
that are used both for the 3D printer to create a physical specimen and to extract the
printing parameters used for calculation using a mathematical model associated with the
virtual section.
The flowchart presented in Figure 1 outlines the process for developing and validating
a tool-code for the integration of modern manufacturing techniques with computational
analysis tools (FEA), Abaqus, to ensure that manufactured parts meet design specifications
and performance criteria.

2.1. Printing Parameter Optimization
To produce a 3D-printed test specimen with optimized mechanical behavior, precise
control over multiple parameters is essential, as these parameters significantly influence
the Filament section. These parameters are presented in Figure 2.

Figure 2. Printing Parameters of 3D-Printed Test Specimens.
The developed interface employs a dual-approach framework that addresses both
physical and geometric aspects through a mathematical model and a shape generator,
collectively managing several critical parameters. Based on Box–Behnken experimental
design, the mathematical model processes printing parameters to generate corrected virtual
filament cross-sections, which are then fed into the shape generator module. The shape
generator uses these corrected cross-sections and link it directly to the path extracted on
G-code to create a meshable 3D geometry that accurately represents the physical printed
structure, including the different printing parameter. The mathematical model takes the
physical parameters: layer thickness, which governs the height of each deposited layer;
extrusion temperature, which controls the material’s temperature during extrusion; printing
speed, which determines the rate of the nozzle’s movement; and raster width, which defines
the width of the extruded material bead. Along with this, the shape generator controls
eight geometric parameters: infill density, which sets the ratio of internal material fill; cross
patterns, which define the intersecting fill geometries; raster orientation, which determines
the pathway direction of material; raster angle, which sets the angle of these pathways; layer
count, which defines the total number of layers; infill pattern, which selects the internal
geometric pattern; perimeter count, which determines the number of outer wall layers;
and print continuity, which ensures continuous deposition transitions. The overall control
over physical and geometric parameters is the foundation of a sound modeling strategy,
resulting in the creation of a mathematical model aimed at process printing improvement.
2.2. Numerical Specimen Generation
The filament used in 3D printing can flatten due to the combined effects of temperature
and contact with the build plate, transforming its initially circular cross-section into an oval-
rectangular shape. This observation aligns with measurements obtained through scanning
electron microscopy, which confirm the altered geometry of the filament after deposition.
The initial virtual section geometry a circular cross-section with diameter matching
the 0.4 mm nozzle was selected to reflect standard slicer assumptions and enable direct
comparison with uncorrected simulation baselines. However, SEM measurements (Figure 3)
revealed consistent flattening (Exp H < nozzle diameter) and widening (Exp L > nozzle
diameter), motivating the need for correction.

Figure 3. The shape of individual filaments is visible in a cross-section of raster layers in scanning
electron microscopy (SEM).
Figure 3 illustrates the distinctive shapes of individual filaments and the area of inter-
action observed through the utilization of scanning electron microscopy. The dimensions
of the experimental filaments, namely Experimental length (Exp L) and Experimental
thickness (Exp H), were determined utilizing the Tabletop SEM model SH-5500P.
2.3. Mathematical Modeling of Virtual Raster Section
The corrected virtual section refers to the experimentally validated cross-sectional
geometry of deposited filaments, which accounts for physical deformation during printing
specifically, the ovalization and flattening caused by extrusion pressure, thermal softening,
and layer adhesion rather than assuming an idealized circular or rectangular cross-section.
This correction is derived from SEM measurements of actual printed filaments under
controlled printing conditions and is calibrated using the Box–Behnken experimental
design to relate printing parameters (layer thickness, raster width, temperature, speed) to
final filament dimensions (virtual width and virtual thickness). The original (uncorrected)
section assumes nominal slicer-defined dimensions (circular filament with diameter equal
to nozzle size), which fails to capture real-world deformation observed experimentally.
To validate the corrected virtual section, we performed a series of experimental tests
using a standard FlashForge FDM printer and measured the actual filament cross-sections
under various printing conditions Table 1 This step focuses on building a mathematical
model that relates certain manufacturing parameters to the dimensions of the virtual
raster section.
This model aims to understand and predict the relationship between manufacturing
parameters, such as print speed and extrusion temperature, raster width, and layer thick-
ness, with virtual raster dimensions, such as the width and height of the deposited filament.
We will use a methodology based on the Box–Behnken method design of experiment. It
has 4 parameters with 3 levels. 27 pieces must be manufactured in parallelepiped form,
then calculate the thickness and height for each part and divide them, respectively, by the
number of threads and the number of layers (Figure 4). The Box–Behnken design was
employed to investigate the effects of four process parameters layer thickness (Lt), raster

The effect of the four parameters, layer thickness, extruder temperature, printing
speed, and raster width, on the dimensions was observed in Figure 5, revealing distinct
trends in virtual thickness and width. The impact on width is more significant due to greater
sensitivity to parameter variations, as evidenced by a wider range of width measurements,
compared to the relatively stable thickness.
Figure 5. Effect of the printing parameter on the dimensions of virtual section, (a) virtual thickness
(b) virtual width.
Figure 5a illustrates that the virtual thickness rises linearly with layer thickness. Thus,
for a given layer thickness, the virtual thickness of the printed object remains constant.
Other print options, such as raster width, extruder temperature, and print speed, do not
significantly affect the virtual thickness. These parameters mainly influence the shape and
surface quality of the printed object, but do not have a direct impact on the thickness of the
deposited material. Therefore, it is possible to consider the virtual thickness to be equal to
the layer thickness for the described printing parameter.
The virtual width is influenced by several print parameters, as shown in Figure 5b. It
increases with layer thickness due to increased material spreading for thicker layers, and
increases with increasing raster width, as this promotes material spreading. On the other
hand, it decreases with higher extruder temperature, because a more fluid material is less
likely to spread. Finally, the virtual width increases with print speed, as a higher speed
reduces deposition time and leaves less time for the material to spread before solidification.

The virtual thickness error of 1.06% suggests a high degree of precision when compared
to experimental data, however the width error of 8% indicates middling accuracy, likely
driven by numerous interactions among process parameters. These discoveries, combined
into the interface’s shape generator, enable for exact modification of internal geometry
during G-code parsing.
The reported “virtual thickness error” of 1.06% and “virtual width error” of 8% were
calculated as the mean absolute percentage error across all 27 Box–Behnken experimental
runs. Specifically, the error for each run was computed using the formula: Error = |Repone
Value −Factor Value|/Factor Value.
Mathematical formula (1) provides an approximate calculation of the virtual width
based on these parameters, significantly improving the accuracy of the Abaqus script
generated by the interface.

The model demonstrates excellent overall fit with an R2 value of 98.85% (95% confi-
dence interval: 97.6–99.5%), indicating that the model explains nearly all of the variability
in the virtual width measurements. The adjusted R2 of 97.51% accounts for the number
of predictors in the model, confirming robust explanatory power without overfitting. The
predicted R2 of 93.39% further validates the model’s strong generalizability to new observa-
tions, while the standard error of 0.018 mm represents high precision in virtual width pre-
diction. The model F-value of 73.82 (p < 0.001) confirms high statistical significance, though
individual components (linear, quadratic, and interaction effects) were not statistically sig-
nificant, suggesting that the complete model’s significance arises from the combined effect
of all parameters rather than individual contributions. This robust statistical foundation
supports the model’s reliability for predicting virtual width in FDM simulations.
The interaction plot for virtual width presented on Figure 6 illustrates how key printing
parameters, layer thickness, raster width, extruder temperature, and printing speed affect
the actual width of extruded filaments in FDM 3D printing. As layer thickness and raster
width increase, the virtual width rises due to greater material spreading. Conversely,
higher extruder temperatures reduce width by improving material flow and reducing
sagging. Printing speed also increases virtual width, as faster deposition limits the time
available for spreading before solidification. The non-parallel lines across the subplots
indicate significant interactions between these variables, highlighting that their effects are
not independent. This confirms the need for a calibrated mathematical model to accurately
predict filament geometry, which is essential for enhancing the fidelity of finite element
simulations in Abaqus.
Ensuring the alignment between the refined virtual cross-section and the G-code path
is crucial for ensuring that the Abaqus simulation accurately represents the physical Fused
Deposition Modeling (FDM) process. The shape generator interprets the Infill Angle param-
eter (0◦, 45◦, 90◦) by rotating the corrected virtual section’s local coordinate system relative
to the global build plate. As illustrated in Figure 7, the integration of the corrected filament
section into the G-code path is demonstrated. The blue line denotes the G-code route

The interface, as illustrated in Figure 8, is embodied in the “Abaqus Script Generator
from G-Code” tool, which features a streamlined and user-friendly design. It includes
a file selection section where users can browse and upload a G-code file (.g), ensuring
direct integration of printer instructions into the simulation environment. Additionally,
the interface provides an “Infill Angle” input field, allowing users to specify angles such
as 0◦, 45◦, or 90◦, which gives the initial start to the corrected virtual section and adjusts
the internal structure of the printed specimen for simulation purposes, ensuring precise
mapping of G-code data to Abaqus’s event series framework for accurate simulations.
A “Generate Abaqus Script” button triggers the conversion process, producing a script
tailored for Abaqus to model the layer-by-layer deposition sequence.

Figure 8. User Interface for G-Code to Abaqus Script Conversion.
The interface was developed in Python 3.8 using an interactive compiler environment
for rapid prototyping and debugging. The final code was integrated into Visual Studio
Code v1.104.0, linked directly to the Abaqus Python API (Abaqus Scripting Interface) via
the Abaqus CAE kernel. This integration allows the tool to generate native Abaqus Python
(.py) scripts that automatically construct the geometry, assign material properties, define
meshing parameters.
2.5. Specimen Preparation and Testing
For the validation, two types of tensile tests were conducted: (i) tests on standard
specimens and (ii) a complementary test on a single extruded filament.
ASTM D638 specimens. To compare numerical predictions with mechanical response,
specimens were prepared according to the ASTM D638 Type V standard. Nine specimens
were printed in total, divided into three groups corresponding to raster orientations of 0◦,
45◦, and 90◦(three specimens per orientation to ensure reproducibility). All specimens
were manufactured from ABS using a FlashForge Creator 3 PRO printer by Zhejiang
Flashforge 3D Technology Co., Ltd. Jinhua, Zhejiang, China. The slicing was performed
with FlashPrint v5.8.3 software, with the following parameters: layer height = 0.2 mm,
nozzle diameter = 0.4 mm, nozzle temperature = 250 ◦C, bed temperature = 80 ◦C, and

print speed = 60 mm/s. A rectilinear infill with 100% density was applied to eliminate
voids. Tensile tests were carried out on an MTS CRITERION MODEL 44 universal testing
machine , MTS Systems Corporation Eden Prairie, Minnesota, United States, at room
temperature under displacement control, following the ASTM procedure (Figure 9). Force
and crosshead displacement were recorded continuously, and engineering stress–strain
curves were derived for each specimen.

tations; (b) monofilament specimen prepared with 145 mm length and 0.4 mm diameter, mounted in

Monofilament test. To characterize the geometry and mechanical response of a single
extruded filament, a dedicated tensile test was performed on one filament sample. The
filament was prepared with a length of 145 mm and a diameter of approximately 0.4 mm,
extruded directly by the same printer and process parameters as the D638 specimens. The
ends of the filament were carefully clamped in a custom-designed fixture, which was in
turn mounted onto the MTS machine. Mechanical grips and additional clamps were used
to minimize slippage and ensure proper load transfer during testing.
For the second part of the experiment, Tensile tests on the filaments were conducted
using a specialized support designed to hold them in place during testing. The mechanical
properties of the filaments are detailed in Table 3 and are injected into Abaqus as mechanical
properties for simulation.

3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Comparative Analysis of Geometries
This section validates the geometric fidelity of our tool by comparing the 3D structures
generated in Abaqus (after G-code processing) against the intended geometries embedded in
the original slicer-generated G-code.
Figure 10 displays two rows of specimens, with the top row representing the geometries
generated by the Abaqus simulation using my tool, and the bottom row showing the geometries
directly generated by the slicer from the G-code. The consistent alignment and similarity
between the two rows indicate that my tool accurately captures the overall shape and geometry
of the specimens as intended by the G-code instructions. Each column in the image corresponds
to a different infill pattern and density configuration, and the internal structures of the specimens,
whether they are honeycomb, grid, or linear infills, are faithfully replicated in both the Abaqus
simulation and the slicer-generated geometries. This precise matching demonstrates that my
tool effectively interprets the G-code to reproduce complex infill patterns with high fidelity.

The specimens manifest equivalent wall layers, infill densities, and orientations across
both the Abaqus simulation and the slicer-generated geometries, thereby substantiating

the tool’s dependability in converting G-code instructions into precise Abaqus geometries
without compromising the intricacies or structural integrity of the original design. The
image reveals no significant differences between the corresponding specimens from the two
sources, suggesting that the tool adeptly minimizes potential errors or variations during
the conversion process. This approach guarantees that the simulation models accurately
replicate the actual printed objects. The precise geometric alignment serves to substantiate
the program’s functionality and precision. This finding suggests that the model can be used
to make predictions in Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) processes, which lends credibility
to the model. The comparative study shows the robust capacity of my developed tool to
convert G-code instructions into Abaqus geometries with excellent precision, reinforcing
its promise as a significant resource for developing the mechanical analysis and simulation
of FDM-printed parts.
As shown in Figure 11, a comparative analysis of a spherical specimen’s geometry
is provided. This analysis is based on the geometry of the specimen, as generated by the
developed tool and the slicer. The top image illustrates the geometry produced by the slicer
from the G-code instructions, while the bottom image displays the geometry generated
by the Abaqus simulation using the developed tool. The perfect matching and consistent
layering across both representations highlight the tool’s ability to precisely interpret G-code
directives and faithfully recreate complex geometries within Abaqus. A comparative analy-
sis of the two images shows that they share identical layer stacking, curvature, and surface
intricacies. This finding confirms that the developed tool effectively captures the detailed
features of the spherical specimen. For instance, the consistent radial coordinates and angu-
lar alignment in both models demonstrate that the tool accurately replicates the intended
spherical dimensions, with layer heights matching precisely. This precise replication of the
slicer’s output in the Abaqus simulation demonstrates the tool’s effectiveness in converting
G-code instructions into accurate simulation geometries, maintaining consistency in layer
height, shape, and internal structures.

A comparative visualization of a NACA duct geometry, a sophisticated aerodynamic
structure widely utilized in aerospace applications, is presented in Figure 12, produced by
both a slicer and a custom-developed tool. The interface of the developed tool displays a
carefully layered construction featuring smooth curvature. The perspective view shows
the tool’s capability and efficiency in capturing the internal layering with precision and
accurate infill patterns, showcasing its ability to reliably interpret G-code instructions. This
high-capability for regeneration shows the tool’s dependability for simulating complex
designs, aligning effortlessly with the output of the slicer, which fill the gap between design
and thermomechanical analysis with precision.

Figure 13 illustrates the analysis of filament interactions. The program excels in the
analysis of the interaction between filaments, which is considered an essential factor in
studying crack propagation, with the central configuration (“Only Theoretical”) presenting
an idealized theoretical model of uniformly stacked green filaments overlaid with orange
and green intertwined networks to symbolize potential interactions, this model does not
reflect a real shape, it is an ideal representation, whereas in reality the filament flattens
underweight and pressure. The right configuration demonstrates a well-defined extrusion
at 0.2 mm layer height, 100% infill, 60 mm/min speed, and 250 ◦C nozzle temperature,
overlapping blue filaments, indicating strong cohesion and structural integrity, suggesting
a desirable outcome in material analysis. In contrast, the left configuration at 0.4 mm layer
height, 100% infill, 60 mm/min speed, and 250 ◦C nozzle temperature, shows filaments
that are less flattened with a weaker interaction zone, implying reduced cohesion and a
potential vulnerability to crack propagation. The diagram highlights filament interaction
analysis by comparing two configurations against a central theoretical model.

The average overlap percentage was 98.3% (SD = 0.7%), with the lowest value
of 97.1% for the most complex NACA duct geometry. The mean surface deviation of

0.018 mm (SD = 0.005 mm). The Dice similarity coefficient averaged 0.992 (SD = 0.003)
across all test cases. The maximum Harsdorf distance was 0.047 mm, well below the
0.1 mm threshold for FDM simulation accuracy. These metrics confirm that our tool
maintains exceptional geometric fidelity while converting G-code to Abaqus geometries.
Figure 14 shows a comparative meshed visualization of an ASTM D638 specimen and
a NACA duct a geometry based on the NACA 0012 airfoil profile, which are meshed using
varying dimensions to illustrate the proficiency of the developed program in generating
and adapting meshes for various structures. The image highlights the program’s versatility
and flexibility of the program, using C3D4 mesh elements with adapted sizes (0.35 to 0.6)
depending on the geometrical complexity of the structures.

The zoomed-in area to the left is the ASTM D638 specimen, which shows the internal
layers fine meshed area that demonstrates the capability of the program to accurately
replicate complex patterns without compromising the integrity of the structure. The NACA
duct, a complex aerodynamic structure, is presented on the right side, with a coarser mesh
that adapts to its contoured, stratified shape, demonstrating the tool’s ability to refine mesh
density according to structural requirements. The two views together draw attention to the
software’s success in generating high-fidelity meshes for application in a range of scenarios,
from tensile test standards to aerodynamics simulations.
3.2. Numerical Model Validation
The experimental tensile curves presented in Figure 15 reveal varying behavior de-
pending on the filament orientation. At 90◦, the material exhibits plasticity with brittle
fracture. At 0◦, it achieves a maximum tensile strength of 41.42 MPa, indicating ductile
fracture. At 45◦, the behavior is intermediate, with an average tensile strength of 38.22 MPa
and ductile fracture.
The numerical tensile testing was carried out on two series of ASTM D638 samples:
one with an uncorrected virtual section and another with the corrected virtual section.
The dimensions of the virtual section were maintained constant along the entire length
of the virtual raster, providing a stable framework for the simulation. Perfect bonding
between filaments and layers was assumed, simplifying the model by eliminating variables
related to imperfect interlayer adhesion. The assumption of perfect interlayer bonding was


## Page 17

adopted to isolate the geometric effects of filament cross-section correction from the complex
thermomechanical phenomena of interlayer adhesion. All simulations were conducted at
room temperature to standardize environmental conditions and avoid thermal variability.
The build platform temperature was assumed to have negligible impact on mechanical
behavior. This approach follows the methodology of Hachimi et al. [19] who demonstrated
that geometric accuracy has a more significant impact on simulation fidelity than minor
variations in material properties for the initial validation phase.

The mechanical properties of the ABS monofilament were assumed to remain un-
changed during extrusion, ensuring consistent material behavior throughout the simulation.
The assumption of constant material properties during extrusion was made to focus on the
geometric fidelity of the virtual section model, as the mechanical properties were measured
from the monofilament test (Table 3) representing the material after solidification.
Figure 16 illustrates the numerical tensile test setup in Abaqus for ASTM D638 speci-
mens at 0◦, 45◦, and 90◦orientations. The meshed model shows one end fixed (“Encastred”)
and the opposite end subjected to a displacement-controlled load along the longitudinal
axis. The displacement magnitude was determined from experimental tensile tests to ensure
alignment with real-world conditions. The selection of C3D4 linear tetrahedral elements
and the element size range of 0.35–0.6 mm was determined through a systematic mesh
convergence study. Simulations were performed with element sizes from 1.0 mm down
to 0.35 mm; a size of 0.55 mm was selected globally as it yielded less than 2% variation in
maximum tensile stress compared to finer meshes, balancing accuracy and computational
cost. In geometrically complex, the mesh was locally refined to 0.35 mm, while uniform
regions used 0.6 mm elements implementing a region-based adaptive strategy. While C3D4
elements are known to exhibit reduced accuracy in capturing stress concentrations and
highly nonlinear material behavior due to their constant strain formulation, they were
chosen for their robustness in meshing irregular, toolpath-derived geometries a critical
requirement for G-code-based simulations.

3.3. Tensile Test Comparison
Figure 17 presents a comparative mechanical analysis of stress–strain curves from
numerical tensile tests of ASTM D638 specimens, conducted using the developed program,
alongside representative experimental tensile curves across three filament orientations:
0◦(a), 45◦(b), and 90◦(c). Each subplot includes four curves: three experimental datasets
labeled “Experimental (1)” in green, “Experimental (2)” in teal, and “Experimental (3)” in
olive, representing multiple trials, representing typical test data. Two numerical simulation
results are included: “Numerical test (Corrected)” marked with blue circles and “Numerical
test (non-Corrected)” marked with red triangles.
For all orientations 0◦, 45◦, and 90◦, the experimental curves exhibit a characteristic
ductile behavior, featuring an initial linear elastic region followed by a nonlinear plastic
region, indicative of yielding and strain hardening. Across the orientations reveals distinct
mechanical behaviors: the 0◦orientation has the highest tensile strength and ductility,
likely due to aligned filament layers maximizing load-bearing capacity. The 45◦orientation
shows an intermediate mechanical property, with reduced strength and ductility attributed
to the angled filament arrangement, which introduces shear stresses, the 90◦orientation
takes the tensile strength and a more brittle response, as perpendicular filaments are less
effective at resisting longitudinal tensile forces, leading to earlier failure. These differences
underscore the impact of filament orientation on mechanical properties.
The “Numerical test (Corrected)” curve follows the experimental data closely in both
the elastic and initial plastic zone, indicating improved accuracy through the corrected
section model, which more accurately simulates filament cohesion and stress distribution.
Conversely, the “Numerical test (non-Corrected)” curve deviates more, especially in the
plastic zone, indicating potential underestimation of ductility and tensile strength as a result
of the uncorrected section’s inability to capture realistic filament behavior. Also included
in each subplot is the color-coded stress distribution map of the specimen, which visually
represents the concentration of stress. The simulation across all orientations shows the
enhanced agreement of the corrected model with experimental observation, thus enhancing
the prediction of mechanical properties like yield strength and ultimate tensile strength, and
verifying its efficacy in optimizing the design and performance of 3D-printed components.

(a) 0◦, (b) 45◦, and (c) 90◦Orientations—Corrected vs. Non-Corrected Numerical Models with the
experimental result.
Initially, the uncorrected section samples showed a reasonable correlation with experi-
mental data, indicating a sound foundation for the simulation technique. However, the new
section results in simulation findings that more closely resemble actual tensile test results,
thereby improving the model’s accuracy. This is because the corrected section model better
captures the interactions of filaments and the distribution of stress, thereby enabling the
simulation to more realistically follow the behavior of the specimen. The analysis under-
scores the instrument’s capability to enhance mesh configurations, markedly augmenting


## Page 20

the correlation between simulated and experimental findings, thereby substantiating the
efficacy of the amended section in advancing simulation accuracy.
For the 90◦orientation specimens, the mechanical behavior exhibited a more brittle
response compared to the 0◦and 45◦orientations, as evidenced by the reduced ductility
and earlier failure. The corrected virtual section model demonstrated strong agreement
with experimental results, achieving R2 = 0.9833 with RMSE = 0.90 MPa. The coefficient
of variation (%CV) across the three replicates was 3.5%, for 45◦achieving R2 = 0.9987
with RMSE = 0.20 MPa. The coefficient of variation (%CV) across the three replicates
was 2.3% and for 0◦achieving R2 = 0.9210 with RMSE = 0.47 MPa. The coefficient of
variation (%CV) across the three replicates was 5.2% which, while higher than the other
orientations, remains within an acceptable range for preliminary validation. The model
accurately captured both the elastic behavior (R2 = 0.955 in strain <0.012) and the transition
to failure, with the stress distribution map in Figure 17c confirming that failure initiates at
the expected location for perpendicular filament arrangements. These statistical metrics
were calculated by comparing the corrected simulation results to the mean value of the
three experimental curves.
Our Box–Behnken-based modeling approach achieves correlation coefficients ex-
ceeding 95% in the elastic zone and 90% in the elastoplastic zone performance metrics
that align with, and in some aspects exceed, recent optimization studies using al-
ternative DOE methods. For instance, Kechagias [32] employed Taguchi L25 design
to optimize flexural strength in ABS FDM prints and reported significant parameter
rankings (infill density, raster angle) but did not quantify simulation-to-experiment
correlation. Our approach explicit modeling of quadratic effects and parameter inter-
actions (layer thickness × temperature), which Taguchi’s linear-additive model cannot
capture without sacrificing orthogonality, and direct output of a predictive equation
(Equation (1)) for virtual geometry. As Kechagias himself notes, “quadratic models can
possibly be used in Taguchi but are not recommended”.
The modified section improves filament adhesion and stress distribution, which may
lead to an increase in tensile strength, whereas the unmodified section demonstrates less
robust interaction zones, suggesting a susceptibility to failure when subjected to load.
4. Conclusions
This study introduces an integrated, experimentally validated workflow that converts
FDM printer G-code into high-fidelity Abaqus simulations by correcting the virtual raster
section for filament deformation. The core innovation lies in a Box–Behnken-calibrated
mathematical model that predicts the true oval-rectangular cross-section of extruded fila-
ments achieving only 1.06% thickness error and 8% width error replacing idealized circular
assumptions. Coupled with a Python-based shape generator, this enables automated
creation of mesh-ready Abaqus models that accurately replicate complex infill patterns
and orientations.
Validation via tensile testing of ASTM D638 specimens (0◦, 45◦, 90◦) confirms the
model’s effectiveness: simulations using the corrected section achieved >95% correlation in
the elastic regime and >90% in the elastoplastic regime significantly outperforming uncor-
rected models. This demonstrates a substantial leap in predicting anisotropic mechanical
behavior directly from printer settings.
Key limitations include assumptions of perfect interlayer bonding and validation
limited to ABS on a single printer. Thermal history and residual stresses were not modeled.
Future work will extend the framework to multi-material prints, incorporate real-
time thermal data, and generalize the tool for broader slicer and printer compatibility. By
transforming G-code from machine instructions into physics-informed simulation inputs,

this tool provides a foundational step toward reliable, predictive digital twins for FDM-
