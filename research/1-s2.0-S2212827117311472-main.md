Abstract 
Additive manufacturing is an emerging technology that enables new product design. However, major inhibitors are long building times and a 
fixed build direction of the workpieces. In this article, new optimization and path planning methods for multi-axis additive manufacturing are 
presented going beyond conventional three-axis systems. This includes an adaptation of the building direction and an algorithm for the special 
case of cylindrical axes. These methods can reduce the production time drastically by avoiding support structures and by using the integration 
of predefined building blocks to substitute the infill. We present both, the new manufacturing process and the necessary computation methods 
for optimal process and path planning. Decreasing the building time and the amount of support structures paves the way for new application 
domains of additive manufacturing in the future.

1. Introduction 
In recent years, additive manufacturing (AM) has become 
an emerging technology of the production industry. The 
potentials of AM are free forming of individual parts in an 
economic process, functional integration, multi-material 
workpiece fabrication and topology optimization [1]. This 
manufacturing method enlarges the possible variety of 
workpieces by overcoming limitations of conventional 
subtractive manufacturing and forming technologies, as 
shown exemplarily in previous work of the authors for 
biomimetic workpieces and processes [2,3]. There is a great 
variety of additive processes that can be grouped in powder 
bed, liquid based and freeform processes [4]. 
This paper focuses on fused deposition modelling (FDM) 
since it is a freeform process that allows the extension to more 
than three axes by adaptation of the kinematics, printing head 
and trajectory planning [5,6]. FDM is limited to thermoplastic 
materials, however, the developed algorithms and strategies 
can be applied to other processes using different materials, 
e.g. wire and arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) for metal 
workpieces [7]. 
State-of-the-art FDM printers are limited to three-axis 
movements 
with 
a 
fixed 
building 
direction 
in 
Z. 
Consequently, the slicing software splits the workpiece 
description, usually STL format [1], into single slices with a 
constant layer thickness limited by the nozzle diameter. For 
each horizontal layer, a two-dimensional path is calculated 
based on the nozzle diameter while focusing on the outer 
geometry. One constant infill pattern is chosen for the 
complete internal workpiece structure (e.g. diagonal infill) 
[8]. The resulting G-code is interpreted and executed by the 
machine control. The main drawback of this approach is the 
limitation to one fixed building direction, causing a possible 
lack of strength [9–11], a stair-step effect on the surface 
[12,13] and the need of support material for overhanging 
structures [12]. Toolpath calculation for five-axis subtractive 
machining (e.g. milling) is state-of-the-art and already 
embedded in commercial CAM software. Concerning multi-
axis AM, recent developments deal with multi-directional 
slicing algorithms by dividing the workpiece in piecewise 
building directions [14]. Within each building direction, the 
conventional slicing strategies are applied yielding the same 
drawbacks as before.

Fig. 1. Multi-axis printing on a seven-axis FDM machine developed at the 
University of Stuttgart. 
The main advantage of multi-directional slicing is the 
reduction of support material by tilting the building table to 
avoid overhanging structures (Fig. 1). The shown prototype is 
a seven-axis FDM machine developed by the authors at the 
University of Stuttgart. The approach of using tilting and 
rotating tables can also be transferred to laser metal deposition 
[15]. Another research work provides an extension from 
conventional three-axis systems to three-dimensional path 
generation for strength-optimized curved layers of the FDM 
process [16]. This formulation is suitable for thin-section, 
slightly curved surface parts but it cannot be applied to solid 
parts and does not consider printing head rotations. 
The main drawback of the algorithms in research and 
industry is that the full potential of multi-axis movements is 
not explored. Therefore, we propose a generic method for 
trajectory planning of multi-axis systems by adapting the 
building direction, demonstrated on a seven axis machine tool 
with FDM printing head. Then, we present a path planning 
strategy for a machine using a rotatory axis instead of a planar 
building bed to demonstrate the new possibilities compared to 
a conventional three-axis system. 
This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes 
basic workpiece features that are relevant for workpieces 
manufactured by AM, especially freeform processes like 
FDM. In Section 3, the algorithms for creating three-
dimensional trajectories for multi-axis FDM are described. 
Section 4 presents preliminary experimental results in a 
laboratory on an industrial machine tool equipped with a 
FDM printing head. The last section provides a summary and 
outlook towards possible future research topics. 
2. Workpiece features 
In order to explore the design freedom given by the multi-
axis FDM process, it is necessary to define workpiece 
features. For conventional AM using three axes, geometrical 
features such as islands and overhangs are described in 
literature [17,18]. Islands are elements which are separated at 
the beginning of the process (Fig. 2 a)), and are then 
connected during the building process (Fig. 2 b)). Parts that 
are solid and stable when completed can therefore be unstable 
during the process.

overhang in building direction Z (adapted from [18]). 
Overhangs may need support structures, depending on the 
down skin angle (Fig. 2 c)). Different down skin angles are 
recommended varying from 40° up to 60°, where 45° are most 
common [19]. The down skin angle is the angle between a 
downwards facing surface (down skin area Fig. 2 b)) and the 
build platform plane [18]. Upwards facing surfaces (Fig. 2 b)) 
are called up skin areas with the up skin angle between the 
surface and the build platform plane [18]. 
In FDM, the workpiece geometry is mostly stored in STL 
files, which describe only the outer geometry [20]. The infill 
pattern and density is chosen manually by the operator and 
remains constant throughout the whole building process [21]. 
Therefore, workpieces with high volume consist mainly of 
infill material depending on the shape and size. Consequently, 
the highest production effort in terms of time and material is 
spent to produce infill patterns that are not described by the 
STL files and are just used as internal workpiece support. One 
approach to reduce material and time consumption is to 
decrease the infill density. However, infill is necessary in 
order to enable the fabrication of the outer layer, especially on 
the top of the workpiece, and it influences the surface quality. 
Therefore, we propose to replace the printed infill pattern 
by pre-manufactured thermoplastic insertions (Fig. 3). Before 
the FDM process starts, the inner workpiece volume is 
assembled by using the available infill elements from a 
module kit. Those elements can be produced faster and 
cheaper by injection molding and can be provided by 
specialized suppliers.

The size, shape and number of these elements must be 
defined in order to derive a decomposition algorithm, which is 
not part of this paper. After assembly of the raw body, the 
outer surface and the difference to the target geometry can 
only be printed by multi-axis FDM due to overhanging 
structures and the reachability of the working area. In order to 
avoid collisions, a new design of the printing head is required. 
A first prototype of such a printing head was realized and 
presented by the authors in a previous work [5]. 
3. Path planning for multi-axis FDM 
In order to fabricate the features described in the previous 
section, multi-axis CAD CAM is needed for path planning. 
First, an approach for dealing with overhanging features 
without support structures is presented. Second, the special 
case of roller applications is described in detail. The described 
transformation for roller application can be generalized and 
used to print the freeform features on the preassembled infill 
blocks described before. 
3.1. Adaptation of the building direction 
An STL file sliced with conventional slicing tools results 
in an ISO code with short linear segments for each movement. 
All segments are in one plane and the height is increased step 
wise after the complete plane is finished. As described above, 
only limited overhangs are possible with this strategy. 
Material is always deposed on the existing plane below. With 
the rotary-tilting table, the part can be inclined to reduce the 
overhang as shown in Fig. 4. The tilting angle B and rotation 
angle C have to be calculated and added to the ISO-code for 
each line, depending on the previous printed geometry. 
3.2. Cylindrical axis 
A special case of a base body composed of predefined 
blocks is a cylinder resulting in a path optimization problem 
that can be solved by using a transformation in cylindrical 
coordinates. Instead of using a conventional planar printing 
bed, an additional rotating axis is mounted on the rotating and 
tilting table, providing another degree of freedom. This 
concept, contains a rotatable build cylinder, where the rotation 
is defined by the angle Φ (Fig. 5). In a first approach, motion 
of the printing head is considered along the axis X and in 
build direction Z for deriving a simplified slicing procedure in 
cylindrical coordinates.

The rotating axis is included into the machine control to 
enable synchronized motions of all axes using CNC 
functionality. This results in a machine with eight axes in 
total. 
3.2.1. Transfer of Features 
The transfer of the geometrical features described earlier 
onto the cylindrical building direction allows exploring the 
freedom of design of this concept. Parts feasible for 
cylindrical printing must contain an inner feature (Fig. 6). The 
inner feature is an opening in the workpiece, which has to be, 
at least partially, cylindrical. Otherwise support structure is 
necessary. The workpiece does not have to encircle the rotary 
cylinder completely. The uncovered angle is called opening 
angle. Overhangs can be divided into two types, axial and 
radial overhangs. The restrictions for overhangs given by the 
FDM process remain the same. Axial overhangs are rotated 
by 90° while printed on the cylinder. In contrast, radial 
overhangs show more specific restrictions to those in common 
building axes. The printing angle α is defined by the position 
vector P and the normal vector N:

Islands occur if there is a split in the cylindrical face of the 
inner feature. This effect does not cause islands on a common 
printer (see Fig. 7 a) and b)). There are also cases that result in 
islands in common printers but not in cylindrical layers as 
shown in Fig. 7 c) and d). 
3.2.2. Path planning for cylindrical printing 
In order to obtain a G-code from a geometrical description 
of the workpiece, several operations are necessary (e.g. CAD, 
transformation, slicing, parsing). The flowchart in Fig. 8 
shows the six steps for printing on a rotatable cylinder axis. 
The first step is creating a suitable CAD model containing 
an inner feature with the same radius r0 as the build cylinder. 
If the workpiece has no opening angle, two internal surfaces 
have to be defined while they can be infinitesimal close to 
each other (Fig. 9). This is necessary to get a closed volume 
after the subsequent transformation in cylindrical coordinates.

In the second step, an STL file is generated while it is 
important to control the element size of the triangulation. Too 
small elements result in an increased file size, whereas too big 
elements yield an imprecise result and can falsify the 
workpiece geometry (Fig. 10 b)). Due to the slicing process, 
which is carried out on the transformed workpiece (cylindrical 
coordinates) in Cartesian coordinates, the so-called chord 
error [22] occurs in an inverse way. Usually, in machining 
and AM the chord error is the difference between the ideal arc 
section and the approximation using linear segments. In this 
case of an inverse chord error, a straight line segment has to 
be approximated by a high number of very small arcs. Fig. 10 
d) shows the chord error after transformation of surfaces that 
are plane when printed compared to the correctly transformed 
shape in Fig. 10 c). The falsified shape results in a circular 
segment in cylindrical coordinates. Besides the precision of 
triangulation, it is important that the coordinate origin is 
located in the center of the cylindrical inner feature. 
Otherwise the transferred model appears differently in 
Cartesian coordinates. 
The third step contains the transformation in cylindrical 
coordinates (equation (3)), combined with a dependency 
between the angle Φ’ and the radius r (equation (4)).

For the calculation of Φ there is a case-by-case analysis 
depending on the quadrant. The reason for the necessary 
dependency between the angle Φ’ and radius r is on the one 
hand the ratio between the amount of extruded melt and the 
driving distance. Increasing the radius results is an increased 
length of the arc segment. Therefore it is necessary either to 
increase the extrusion rate or decrease the rotation speed of 
the axis. On the other hand, a constant infill density 
throughout the radius is requested. Fig. 11 shows the 
workpiece from Fig. 10 c) in radius dependent cylindrical 
coordinates illustrated in Cartesian coordinates. 
In the fourth step the transformed STL file from Fig. 11 is 
sliced in a conventional slicer software, which results in a G-
code file. In this step, all common parameters can be chosen 
like during conventional slicing. The correct orientation is 
essential to be consistent with the subsequent calculation. 
For a correct printing path the actual angle Φ of the 
rotating axis is needed. Therefore, the angle dependency of Φ’ 
is reversed in the fifth step. Equation (5) shows the respective 
equation.

The final step consists of parsing the G-code, which is a 
simple adjustment such that the code becomes compatible 
with the specific printer commands (e.g. m-functions). 
4. Preliminary experimental results 
Experiments were carried out on an industrial machine tool 
for milling with seven axes using industrial control systems 
(PLC and CNC). The machine tool was equipped with an 
FDM printing head instead of a spindle. 
4.1. Substitution of the infill by pre-manufactured blocks 
For substitution of the infill, a demonstrator workpiece was 
designed that cannot be fabricated without support material 
using conventional three-axis FDM (Fig. 12 a)). The main 
body was assembled by gluing 12 black cubes with an edge 
length of 20 mm (Fig. 12 b)).

printed top geometry (blue). 
Afterwards, the geometry on top of the base body was 
printed with blue filament. The building time was reduced by 
79,2 % (45 min instead of 216 min) and the filament 
consumption was reduced by 84,6 % (4.276 mm instead of 
27.708 mm) compared to conventional FDM of the part. 
4.2. Adaptation of building direction 
A simple sphere with one shell and no infill is used to 
demonstrate the potential of multi-axis FDM. The black 
sphere in Fig. 13 a) was printed in a conventional way using 
three axes. For a certain overhang angle the structure 
collapses, which can be seen on top of the workpiece. In 
contrast to this, multi-axis FDM using allows the successful 
fabrication of the same workpiece, as it is shown in Fig. 13 b). 
In addition, the sphere was used as base body for printing the 
ISW logo on the surface (orange letters). This workpiece was 
fabricated using seven axes including three Cartesian axes (X, 
Y and Z), the rotating and tilting table (B1 and C1) and two 
degrees of freedom in the printing head carrier (B2 and C2). 
4.3. Printing on cylindrical axis 
The workpiece printed on a cylindrical base body using the 
transformation into cylindrical coordinates was fabricated on 
the same machine (Fig. 14 a)). The rotational axis was 
mounted on the rotating and tilting table. In the experimental 
setup two printing heads were used for parallel printing on the 
same base body. Fig. 14 b) shows the workpiece after it was 
removed from the cylindrical base body. No support 
structures were necessary and the surface was smoother 
compared to the same workpiece fabricated using three axes.

5. Conclusion and outlook 
Current FDM processes show limitations with respect to 
building times and mechanical workpieces properties caused 
by a layer wise building process in one fixed direction on 
three-axis machines. One major drawback is the time and 
material consuming fabrication of inner infill structures. Those 
limitations can be overcome by multi-axis FDM including 
more than three axes in machine kinematics. This allows to 
replace the workpiece infill by assembled elements. The 
resulting base body serves as starting point for the surface 
printing, which requires new methods for path planning in 
order to exploit the full potential of multi-axis systems. 
This paper proposes a strategy for cylindrical base bodies 
using a transformation in cylindrical coordinates. By this 
transformation conventional slicing software can be used for 
path planning in order to print any feature on the base body. 
However, base bodies of arbitrary shape require more 
sophisticated strategies and also hardware modifications of the 
printing head. Experimental results show the feasibility of the 
proposed methods on a seven-axis machine tool. 
The proposed strategies use all seven axes of the machine, 
however, the slicing algorithms are applied layer wise. In 
future, completely new slicing algorithms must be developed 
that are not limited to fixed layers. This will enable the 
additive production of workpieces with completely new 
mechanical properties and degrees of freedom in design 
compared to conventional FDM processes. This technology 
will explore new application domains and industrial products.
