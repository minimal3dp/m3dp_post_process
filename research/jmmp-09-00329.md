Abstract
By greatly increasing automation, accuracy, and flexibility at every step of the additive man-
ufacturing process, from design and production to quality assurance, artificial intelligence
(AI) is revolutionizing the 3D printing industry. The integration of AI algorithms into 3D
printing systems enables real-time optimization of print parameters, accurate prediction
of material behavior, and early defect detection using computer vision and sensor data.
Machine learning (ML) techniques further streamline the design-to-production pipeline
by generating complex geometries, automating slicing processes, and enabling adaptive,
self-correcting control during printing—functions that align directly with the principles
of Industry 4.0/5.0, where cyber-physical integration, autonomous decision-making, and
human–machine collaboration drive intelligent manufacturing systems. Along with im-
proving operational effectiveness and product uniformity, this potent combination of AI
and 3D printing also propels the creation of intelligent manufacturing systems that are
capable of self-learning. This confluence has the potential to completely transform sectors
including consumer products, healthcare, construction, and aerospace as it develops. This
comprehensive review explores how AI enhances the capabilities of 3D printing, with
a focus on process optimization, defect detection, and intelligent control mechanisms.
Moreover, unresolved challenges are highlighted—including data scarcity, limited gener-
alizability across printers and materials, certification barriers in safety-critical domains,
computational costs, and the need for explainable AI.

1. Introduction
This review intends to identify relevant journal and conference publications and to
extract useful information to provide valuable insights to researchers and enthusiasts in
AI and additive manufacturing (AM) field. To adopt a transparent approach to assess and
collect literature about the incorporation of AI in additive manufacturing, research database
platforms like ScienceDirect, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and Google Scholar were explored from
2015 to 2025 using keywords like AI in additive, machine learning in 3D printing, intelligent
control WAAM, defect detection, and real-time monitoring. The scholarly criteria were

narrowed down to peer-reviewed journals and conference proceedings focused on factual
validations and practical implementation of AI-assisted additive manufacturing [1–3].
3D printing—what was once fictional—has now become the governing technology
of the 21st century, spanning every manufacturing industry, from kids’ toys to concrete
structures. Also known as additive manufacturing, it works by executing a digital design
file, known as a computer-aided design (CAD) file, by adding the required material layer
by layer, minimizing waste, whereas its counterpart, traditional manufacturing, works
by subtracting material. The layer-by-layer addition of material enables the fabrication
of complex geometries which are impossible to achieve by conventional manufacturing.
Three-dimensional printing, which began as a prototyping tool in the 1980s [4–6], is now
one of the most powerful innovative engines, spanning industries from aerospace, automo-
tive, and construction to fashion [7,8].
With the ongoing evolution of 3D printing comes the challenge of navigating countless
parameters, real-time decision-making, and geometric intricacies. These limitations give
great scope to AI to incorporate intelligence in additive manufacturing. AI aims to create
building machines that can impersonate and sometimes exceed human cognitive abilities
like reasoning, learning, and decision-making. It is a collection of powerful systems across
various industries, like automating the automotive industry and disease prediction in the
medical industry. The combination of AI and 3D printing technologies marks the beginning
of a new era of intelligent manufacturing. When it comes to 3D printing, AI refines the
process from being static and preprogrammed to a robust and adaptable one by optimizing
print paths, detecting defects mid-build, and even generating digital blueprints for entirely
new structural designs by learning from past prints.
This powerful coordination is supported by several key motivations, such as the ability
of AI to perform complex permutations simultaneously, as it can explore several thousand
of them, compared to traditional design solutions, which often include human assumptions.
In addition to that, AI can monitor and control the process in real-time with various sensors
to detect manufacturing defects, assuring quality. This enables reduced human intervention,
which in turn makes 3D printing accessible to non-experts [2,3]. Economically, AI’s design
optimization by identifying sustainable design strategies will allow the conservative use of
material, reducing wastage and cost [9], as demonstrated by Srivastava et al. [10].
The process of 3D printing generates a large amount of data because it is susceptible
to many variables like flow rate, printing inconsistencies, temperature fluctuations, and
geometric deviations, as it progresses layer-by-layer, which requires continuous monitoring.
This data can be analyzed and interpreted by AI, and machine learning algorithms can
be trained to recognize patterns and predict outcomes. In recent times, real-time defect
detection technology based on deep learning has been introduced by G. Wang et al. to
produce 3D microelectronics by training and introducing a new algorithm, YOLOv8 [11].
This real-time detection also contributes to predictive maintenance to minimize downtime.
Furthermore, AI-enabled 3D printers are self-learning, adapting to real-time materials
and geometries on the go [12]. As manufacturing industries are shifting towards 3D
printing, the combination of AI and 3D printing is laying the groundwork for automation
in manufacturing plants, enhancing accuracy, sustainability, and customizability.
The urgency of integrating AI into additive manufacturing is particularly evident at
this stage of technological and industrial development. As AM transitions from a prototyp-
ing tool to fully industrialized production, the demand for higher reliability, repeatability,
and scalability has never been greater. Conventional process control approaches are in-
sufficient to handle the large volume of variables and real-time adaptability required in
industrial environments. AI transforms AM into a data-driven, intelligent, and autonomous
manufacturing paradigm, which is essential for industries operating under the principles

of Industry 4.0 and moving toward Industry 5.0, where human–machine collaboration and
sustainability play a central role.
Therefore, the objective of this paper is to explore the integration of AI in 3D printing
and its impact on industry. Specifically, this review aims to: (i) critically examine the meth-
ods and technologies through which AI enhances AM processes such as design, monitoring,
optimization, and quality assurance; (ii) contextualize these advancements within Indus-
try 4.0/5.0 and highlight their transformative impact on manufacturing ecosystems; and
(iii) identify unresolved challenges, research gaps, and future directions that must be ad-
dressed for AI-driven AM to achieve industrial maturity. By clarifying both the motivation
and objectives, this paper provides a structured roadmap for researchers and practitioners
working at the intersection of AI and AM.
This review uniquely integrates AI-driven optimization, automation, and intelligent con-
trol in 3D printing, framing their role in Industry 4.0/5.0 and outlining both the transformative
potential and unresolved challenges that have not been consolidated in prior literature.
2. Challenges of Additive Manufacturing
Mechanical Anisotropy and Quality: In techniques where production is carried out
layer by layer, it is seen that the efficiency of strength in the materials decreases depending
on the build direction. This shows that the bond between the layers changes in efficiency
based on the production direction direction [13,14].
Material Limitations: The range of materials in additive manufacturing is not as ex-
tensive as in traditional methods. For example, photopolymer resins are brittle and are not
suitable for every production method; high-performance polymers (e.g., PEEK, PEI) require
working with high-cost equipment. The reason for this is the necessity of producing at the
desired standards with additive manufacturing [15]. Non-Newtonian material behavior in
extrusion-based 3D printing presents particular challenges that AI systems must address.
Materials exhibiting shear-thinning or thixotropic behavior require sophisticated under-
standing of rheological properties that current AI models may inadequately capture [16].
Bioactive ink optimization represents a missed opportunity to demonstrate AI adaptability
across material categories. Recent research in bioprinting shows how machine learning
algorithms can optimize complex bioink formulations through Bayesian optimization ap-
proaches [17]. These applications demonstrate AI’s potential for handling materials with
unique challenges, including cell viability requirements and complex rheological behaviors.
Multi-material 3D printing applications present additional complexity that the manuscript
should address more thoroughly. Co-sintering challenges in ceramic printing require care-
ful material pairing and shrinkage behavior adaptation. AI systems must understand
these material interactions to optimize printing parameters effectively, yet current research
shows limited success in handling such complexity [17]. Cross-material knowledge transfer
represents both an opportunity and a challenge for AI systems. While transfer learning
approaches show promise for adapting models across similar materials, substantial gaps
remain when transitioning between material categories [18]. Temperature-dependent
material behaviors add another layer of complexity that AI systems must address. High-
performance polymers and metal powders exhibit different thermal responses that affect
printing outcomes [19]. Current AI models may struggle to generalize across these thermal
regimes without extensive retraining.
Speed and Scale: Additive manufacturing methods are generally slow methods and
are not suitable for mass production of large-scale objects because they take hours or even
days [20,21].
Cost: One major drawback of additive manufacturing is the high price of not only
the machines but also the raw materials, such as metal powders and resins. The advanced

setup that can perform high-tech alloy or polymer processes will need a very large amount
of money, which is usually far more than that of traditional manufacturing machines.
In addition, the production of high-purity metal powders involves complex atom-
ization and quality control processes, which further raise material prices. Compared to
traditional methods, the cost challenge becomes clearer. For example, high-speed ma-
chining of a titanium alloy block also incurs significant expenses due to tool wear, energy
consumption, and material waste.
Nevertheless, the slow build rates in additive manufacturing and the resulting lim-
ited economies of scale have made additive manufacturing even more expensive [21].
While machining is often criticized for material wastage through subtractive processes,
the faster cycle times and well-developed infrastructure make it more cost-effective in
large-volume production.
Eventually, the question of whether additive manufacturing is economically feasible
comes down to the extent that it can offset the high costs with its characteristic advantages,
namely design freedom, lightweighting, and assembly reduction. The machine efficiency,
material production, and process scalability that come with technology growth are the
factors that are expected to help close the cost gap with conventional manufacturing.
Post-Processing: After production is completed, post-processes such as removal of
supports, heat treatment, and surface finishing increase the cost [22].
Standardization and Quality Control: In fields such as aviation and medicine, the
formation of quality and safety standards is still not completed. The reason for this is that
additive manufacturing is still developing. Recently, quality control systems systems have
been developed using AI, but in AM methods, the detection of defects is more complex
compared to other methods. Because of this situation, detection is difficult [23].
Cyber-Physical Security Vulnerabilities: The integration of digital design files, AI-
driven process control, and internet-connected hardware creates a complex cyber-physical
system with an expanded attack surface. Malicious actors can target multiple points in
the AM workflow, with motivations ranging from intellectual property theft to outright
sabotage. One of the most egregious risks is tampering with digital files to subtly—and
often invisibly—inject flaws into a finished part. Attackers may find ways by which they
could change the CAD file or G-code that resulted from an AI-driven slicer, adding in small
internal voids not originally present or changing geometric tolerances of some critical part
(e.g., an aircraft turbine blade or a load-bearing implant) [24]. These defects, which were
meant to fail only under certain operational pressures, could have disastrous effects. The
AI control system could be a target of attack itself; if the machine learning model were
compromised, the model could be modified to converge to a set of printing parameters that
overall decrease part quality for the entire production run.
As smart factories become more reliant on interconnected, AI-managed systems, they
also become vulnerable to denial-of-service or ransomware attacks. A malicious actor
could compromise the central AI controller, halting production across an entire facility and
holding the operation hostage until a ransom is paid [25]. This represents a significant
threat to supply chain stability and manufacturing resilience.
Environmental and Intellectual Property Issues: The amount of energy consumed in
the AM method, material recycling, and the easy duplication of digital files are still being
debated. Because of this, it is concluded that there are still gaps in the AM method, and
this situation provides a large research area [20].
Many studies are being carried out to overcome these challenges. For example, in
the FDM method, the use of fiber-reinforced filaments and the optimization of printing
parameters can result in increased efficiency [26,27]. It is seen that production systems such
as metallic glasses, biodegradable resins, and hybrid manufacturing expand the production

range of AM and address more fields. The use of AI in production and the development of
large-volume machines are among the efforts aimed at increasing efficiency [23].
In general, with developments in AM processes, materials, and software, many of the
current disadvantages will turn into advantages. The design flexibility, customization, and
low waste offered by AM help overcome disadvantages such as cost and speed and enable
the development of applications.
3. AI-Driven Innovations in 3D Printing: The Role of AI and Its Benefits
The integration of AI into 3D printing has led to groundbreaking advancements in opti-
mization, automation, and intelligent control. AI enhances 3D printing by improving design
accuracy, predicting failures, automating processes, and enabling real-time adjustments [28].
By analyzing vast amounts of data, AI-driven systems can make informed decisions that
enhance print quality, minimize waste, and expedite production times. The following section
is an explanation of AI concepts and key types relevant to 3D printing innovations.
3.1. AI in Manufacturing: Types of AI Used in 3D Printing
3.1.1. Machine Learning (ML)
Machine learning (ML) involves algorithms that learn from data to improve perfor-
mance without explicit programming. In 3D printing, ML plays a crucial role in predictive
maintenance, where it detects potential machine failures before they occur. It also opti-
mizes printing processes by adjusting parameters such as speed, temperature, and material
flow in real time. Additionally, ML enables generative design, where AI suggests optimal
structures based on load requirements, leading to lighter and stronger components [29].
3D micro-printing is a highly detailed extreme AM method that allows the creation
of small and tiny structures on the scale of micrometers or even nanometers with very
high accuracy. The main applications of this technology are in areas such as biomedical
devices, microelectronics, and photonics, in which small and complicated shapes are necessary.
One of the most established methods is two-photon polymerization (2PP), which uses fo-
cused femtosecond lasers to solidify photosensitive resins at extremely fine resolutions [30].
One example of where ML is applied is in Bayesian parameter optimization. Johnson et al.
applied an active-learning framework (Bayesian optimization) to 3D micro-printing. They
used a Gaussian-process surrogate to predict optimal printing parameters for projection multi-
photon lithography iteratively. With only a few hundred training points, the model reduced
print errors to within measurement tolerance in just four iterations [31]. This ML-driven
approach replaces exhaustive trial-and-error with a digital twin that guides process settings
for new designs.
Another application of AI in 3D printing is the tuning of fused deposition modeling
(FDM) for multiple objectives. Panico et al. combined the design of experiments with
machine learning to optimize fused filament prints [32]. They trained a Random Forest
regressor on tensile test data, boosting predictive accuracy (test R2) by over 40%. A genetic
algorithm (NSGA-II) then searched for parameter sets (layer height, extrusion temp, speed,
infill pattern) that maximize strength and stiffness. Figure 1 shows 3D printing factors and
their effect on ultimate tensile strength (UTS), elastic modulus (E), and strain at maximum
stress (εd). UTS and E are primarily influenced by the infill pattern factor, while the layer
thickness primarily affects εd, although minor differences are observed among all factors
for this response. The ML-optimized settings (e.g., a lines infill pattern) yielded specimens
with higher tensile strength and modulus than standard settings, confirming the model’s
predictions [32].

Figure 1. Effect of 3D printing parameters on mechanical properties [32].
The outcome of Panico et al. is summarized in in Figure 2a,c,e which shows that the
RF model predictions closely align with the target values (R2 > 0.80 for all cases), indicating
strong predictive performance and over 40% improvement compared to the RSM method.
To compare the RSM and RF methods, the average of four experimental observations per
run was used as the target. Figure 2b,d,f shows the residuals (as percentages), revealing that
the RF model consistently has the lowest residuals, confirming its superior accuracy [32].

Another example is real-time defect detection. Wang et al. built a deep-learning vi-
sion system to monitor extrusion-based 3D printing layer by layer [11]. They trained an
enhanced YOLOv8 convolutional network to recognize four defect types (scratches, holes,
over-extrusion, and impurities) in real-time. The model achieved a mean average precision of
91.7% at ~72 frames per second [23], enabling on-the-fly quality control. It is highly important
to note that these findings in terms of performance measures were curated from an in-house
dataset under controlled laboratory conditions. The model’s robustness against variations in
material, ambient lighting, and different printer kinematics remains an open question for
industrial deployment. In practice, this enables the printer to flag or halt operations upon
detecting anomalies, significantly automating the inspection process.
Closed-loop reinforcement learning (RL) control is also utilized in 3D printing. M.
Piovarci et al. demonstrated a reinforcement-learning controller for direct ink writing
(DIW). Trained in simulation, the RL agent learned to adjust nozzle speed and deposition
path based on in situ feedback. When deployed on real hardware, the learned policy
outperformed fixed (open-loop) controls, correcting material flow errors in real-time and
producing more accurate single-layer prints [33]. This demonstrates that ML can enable
printers to self-correct, adapting process parameters in real-time.
ML can perform integrated error prediction and local tuning. K.A Hunt et al., de-
veloped a system that couples defect detection with local parameter optimization. The
tool captures layer images and predicts the likelihood of defects at each location; it then
computes locally optimal printing settings to avoid those flaws. In effect, the printer self-
optimizes by adjusting parameters for each area of the part to maximize overall quality.
As described in the NASA report, a tool was developed that can predict and implement
locally optimized printing parameters consisting of elements to detect errors, predict flaw
probability at each point, and select the optimal local parameters [34].
Garboczi et al. used ML and sensors to predict wear in metal AM parts. They
instrumented laser-fused maraging-steel specimens with strain gauges and eddy-current
probes to monitor fatigue. By correlating the signals with damage, the system functions
like an odometer for part life, where increases in sensor readings indicate accumulating
damage. This enabled forecasting part failure before it happens. As Lab Manager reports,
the study showed the Army could detect and monitor the wear and tear of 3D-printed
maraging steel through sensor measurement, using those signals to predict when parts will
degrade or fail [35].
Industry is also using AI for printer maintenance scheduling. For example, startup
SAMGEN’s Prediction software, launched in 2025, continuously collects data from key
printer components (heated bed, fans, motors, etc.) and uses ML algorithms to predict
remaining useful life (RUL). By analyzing patterns in historical and live sensor data, the
software alerts users when a part is likely to wear out. According to 3DNatives, Prediction
can help accurately predict the maintenance needs of 3D printers, optimize operations,
avoid unnecessary downtime, and eliminate excessive use of spare parts [36].
Researchers advocate creating AI-enabled digital twins of 3D printers that mirror the
physical machines in software, enabling end-to-end automation. These twins use real-time
sensor data and ML models to simulate and control the print process. A recent review notes
that integrating ML into digital twins can convert offline simulation into a real-time, closed-
loop production system, where the twin autonomously adjusts parameters and predicts
failures [37]. Such end-to-end automation (from design through print to maintenance)
promises fully self-monitoring, self-optimizing 3D printing workflows under Industry
4.0/5.0 paradigms.

3.1.2. Deep Learning (DL)
Deep learning (DL) is a subset of ML that uses neural networks to analyze complex
patterns. In 3D printing, DL is beneficial for defect detection, where convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) analyze layer-by-layer print quality to identify imperfections. DL also
advances material science by predicting how new materials will behave under 3D printing
conditions, allowing for the development of innovative composites and alloys.
Deep learning facilitates optimization through parameter tuning and predictive mod-
eling of outcomes. The following examples illustrate this.
Recent work has shown that DL models can learn the complex mapping from printer
settings to part quality and then be used to find the best settings. For example, K. A.
Hunt et al. envisioned a system where a network views a part geometry and predicts
locally optimal printing parameters. They built a tool that predicts and implements locally
optimized printing parameters in 3D printing, selecting the best speed, temperature, etc.,
at each point to maximize part quality [34]. Similarly, Kadauw trained multiple artificial
neural networks (ANN) on SLA (stereolithography) process data to predict key mechanical
outcomes (tensile/yield strength, hardness, surface roughness) from print parameters.
Their ANN models achieved very high accuracy (correlation R ≈0.99 between predictions
and measurements) for all properties [38], and they then used multi-objective optimization
on the trained models to find the printer settings that maximize strength and minimize
roughness. Zhang et al. adopted a vision-based approach, building a convolutional neural
network (CNN) (called MPR-Net) that utilizes metallography images of LPBF-printed 316L
stainless steel to predict tensile strength and hardness. The network achieved R2 ≈values
of approximately 0.96 (tensile) and 0.91 (hardness) on test parts and was used to identify
the laser power and scan speed that yielded nearly full-density parts (~99.97% dense) with
a tensile strength of approximately 763 MPa [39]. These examples illustrate how deep nets
serve as accurate surrogate models of the print outcome, enabling automated tuning of
process parameters for optimal part performance.
Real-time defect detection and quality inspections using deep vision in automation
are now feasible. Deep convolutional networks have been applied to monitor builds and
catch defects as they form. Hespeler et al. demonstrated a CNN-based quality monitor in a
laser-directed deposition process. By classifying each printed layer as either acceptable or
porous, the network achieved approximately 90% accuracy in distinguishing layers with
significant internal defects [40]. In extrusion-based printing, Zhou et al. developed an
improved YOLOv8 object-detection CNN to identify four common defects (cracks, holes,
etc.) in 3D-printed microelectronics. Their model ran at ~72 fps and achieved a mean
average precision (mAP50) of 91.7% on live printing images [21], demonstrating real-time
deep learning defect detection.
The collaborative autonomous extrusion network (CAXTON) is an end-to-end moni-
toring/control system for FDM printers. A network of webcams captures the nozzle tip,
while a single multi-headed CNN processes the images. CAXTON automatically labels
deviations from optimal settings and simultaneously detects and corrects multiple error
modalities in real time [41]. In other words, the CNN not only classifies the current error
(e.g., under-extrusion, layer shift) but also feeds back adjustments to the printer. These and
similar systems (often using CNN variants or one-stage detectors) provide automated in
situ quality inspection and process monitoring, flagging surface flaws or internal voids as
they arise and even trigger corrective actions without human intervention.
Intelligent control is achieved through machine-learning-driven closed-loop adaptive
printing systems. Researchers have used deep learning in feedback loops to adapt print
parameters on the fly. Mieszczanek et al. demonstrated this for melt-electrowriting (a fine
polymer fiber printing). By imaging the polymer jet during printing and feeding that into a


## Page 9

9 of 32
feed-forward neural network with a feedback loop, the system actively adjusts flow rate
and speed to stabilize fiber deposition. Their results showed that this AI-enabled closed-
loop control greatly improved reproducibility of a highly nonlinear printing process [42].
Reinforcement learning (RL) has also been applied to 3D printing control. M. Piovarci
et al. trained an RL agent (in simulation) to modulate a direct-ink-write print head. The
learned closed-loop policy, when deployed on actual hardware, outperformed traditional
controllers and had a minimal sim-to-real gap [33]. In effect, the RL controller learned
how to adjust extrusion parameters in real time based on sensor feedback, correcting for
disturbances. On a larger scale, B. Felbrich et al. used model-free deep RL (TD3 and
SAC) in a robotic fabrication framework: a DRL-trained robot learned to plan and execute
structures (e.g., concrete 3D printing) with on-board sensing. Their two case studies (block
stacking and sensor-adaptive 3D printing) showed that deep RL can autonomously handle
complex constraints and adapt on the fly, effectively bringing closed-loop adaptivity to
architectural-scale AM [43]. These works illustrate the trend toward intelligent closed-loop
systems in AM, where deep networks or RL agents continuously adjust print parameters
(temperature, speed, flow, etc.) based on live data, rather than relying on fixed pre-set
values [33].
3.1.3. Computer Vision
Computer vision refers to AI systems that interpret visual data from cameras or
sensors. In 3D printing, computer vision enables real-time monitoring by detecting issues
like layer misalignment, warping, or cracks as they happen. It also ensures quality control
by comparing printed objects with their digital models, ensuring precision and consistency
across production runs. Examples of optimization, automation, and intelligent control in
computer vision for 3D printing are shown below.
One example of visual feedback optimization is an automated calibration system for
FDM printers. G. S. Ganitano et al. developed a system that prints a known calibration
object and utilizes a camera to compare the actual print with its 3D model. A computer-
vision metric (comparing the image to the CAD model) is combined with a metaheuristic
algorithm to adjust print parameters iteratively. This closed-loop vision-based calibration
achieved sub-millimeter geometric accuracy, with an average deviation of 0.047 mm,
thereby improving print quality beyond the printer’s nominal tolerance [44].
For automated defect detection, W. Wang et al. integrated a camera and deep learning
into an extrusion 3D printer to identify print errors in real time. As the printer builds each
layer, a high-resolution camera captures the surface and feeds the images into an enhanced
YOLOv8 convolutional network, which is trained on common FDM defects (e.g., scratches,
over extrusion, voids). The system achieved 91.7% mean average precision (mAP) at
~71.9 frames per second, enabling on-the-fly identification of failures [23]. By classifying
defects as they occur, the printer can halt or correct the print, automating quality control
during manufacturing.
A recent demonstration of vision-guided adaptive control comes from melt electrowrit-
ing (MEW) 3D printing. P. Mieszczanek et al. used a camera to image the fine polymer jet
during printing and applied a neural-network control in a feedback loop. In real time, the
computer vision system measures the jet angle and Taylor-cone area, and a feedforward
neural network plus optimizer adjusts process parameters (voltage, flow rate, etc.) to
achieve the target fiber diameter. This closed-loop, vision-based control ensured repro-
ducible part geometry by continuously modifying the printer’s behavior based on the
live image feedback [42]. A key limitation of vision-based systems is their sensitivity to
environmental conditions. Variations in ambient lighting, camera angle, and reflective

environments or more robust, multi-modal sensing approaches to be viable for industrial
shop floors.
3.1.4. Reinforcement Learning (RL)
Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of AI that learns through trial-and-error, using
rewards and penalties to refine its actions. In 3D printing, RL is applied to create self-
correcting printers that adjust settings mid-print to avoid failures. It also optimizes robotic
control in multi-axis 3D printing, enabling more complex and efficient manufacturing
processes. Here are some examples of how RL is used in innovations related to 3D printing.
RL is increasingly used to improve 3D printing by tuning process parameters, automat-
ing decision-making, and enabling closed-loop control. For example, Ali et al. proposed a
digital-twin RL framework for robotic AM that integrates multiple functions. Their system
uses a vision-based monitor and a Soft Actor-Critic agent to adjust print parameters in real
time continuously [3]. By synchronizing a Unity simulation with a physical robot arm, the
agent learns to correct printing errors in real-time, resulting in rapid policy convergence
and robust print execution. This combined approach integrates parameter tuning, quality
monitoring, and adaptive control within one RL pipeline, achieving stable adjustments of
flow rate and temperature and consistent print quality [45].
S. Dharmadhikari et al. demonstrated RL for parameter optimization in metal AM.
They cast laser power and scan velocity selection as an RL problem: a Q-learning agent
explores the (power, speed) space to maximize rewards for steady melt-pool depth In
simulation, the agent learns a Q-table where the state (power, speed) with the high-
est Q-value corresponds to the optimal settings. For instance, targeting a 1 mm melt-
pool depth in SS316L steel, the trained RL agent predicted an optimal setting (888.9 W,
566.7 mm/min) that matched experimental results within 50 µm. This example shows how
RL can automatically tune printing speed, layer energy, and other parameters to optimize
print quality and consistency [46].
M. Sun et al. applied RL to automate job scheduling in an AM factory. They modeled
the dynamic scheduling of printers (with random order arrivals and machine constraints)
as a Markov decision process and train a dueling deep Q-network (O3-DDQN) to assign
jobs adaptively. The RL scheduler outperforms single scheduling rules, random rules, and
a classic DQN, reducing overall tardiness by about 13% compared to heuristic baselines. In
other words, the learned policy automatically prioritizes and sequences print jobs (possibly
out of order) to improve throughput and on-time delivery. This illustrates how RL can
automate complex planning tasks, continuously optimizing job allocation without human
intervention [47].
M. Piovarci et al. provided a clear case of closed-loop RL control in 3D printing. They
trained an agent in simulation to adjust deposition parameters during direct ink writing.
The resulting policy was then deployed on a real printer to compensate for material and
process variability. As reported, they demonstrated the feasibility of learning a closed-
loop control policy for AM using reinforcement learning, and the policy outperformed
baseline controllers when applied to a single-layer print. In practice, the RL agent observes
the ongoing print and continuously tweaks nozzle speed and material feed to prevent
defects. This on-the-fly adjustment exemplifies an intelligent control loop, where RL
enables real-time corrections and improves print reliability [33]. The implementation of RL
in manufacturing processes has been largely a success. Despite these successes, a significant
hurdle for RL in AM is the ‘sim-to-real’ gap, where policies trained in simulation often
fail when deployed on physical hardware due to unmodeled physics and system noise.
Furthermore, the sample inefficiency of many RL algorithms makes training directly on
physical printers prohibitively slow and expensive.

3.1.5. Natural Language Processing (NLP) and AI Assistants
Natural language processing (NLP) allows AI to understand and generate human
language. In 3D printing, NLP enables voice or text-based control, allowing users to
command printers using AI assistants (e.g., optimizing this part for strength). It also
automates documentation by generating reports on print performance, reducing manual
effort and improving traceability. NLP and AI assistants are helping to improve 3D printing.
Here are some examples that explain more.
AI Build’s AiSync is a unified 3D printing AI platform that uses a GPT-4-based assistant
to manage the entire workflow [48]. AiSync acts as both a slicer and a process controller:
it controls the entire 3D printing process, including monitoring, control, measurement,
and optimization. Users simply type high-level commands (e.g., optimize for strength),
and the AI copilot generates optimized toolpaths and print settings accordingly [48]. By
combining design interpretation, parameter tuning, and machine integration into a single
interface, AiSync automates setup, slicing, and adaptive adjustments across the print job
with minimal expert input.
In terms of optimization, NLP-driven tuning is possible. Tools like Style2Fab enable
users to describe their design goals in plain language and automatically refine the 3D model
for printing. For instance, Style2Fab takes a prompt such as “make it pink and rough”
and adds those esthetic changes without breaking the part’s function. The system uses
deep learning to segment the model into functional vs. nonfunctional parts, then applies
the requested stylizations only to the esthetic regions. In this way, design requirements
expressed in natural language are converted into an optimized 3D model that is ready for
printing, even by users with little CAD experience [49].
Conversational AI can automate printing steps like G-code generation and job initi-
ation. For example, a recent student project built an NLP pipeline where a user simply
dictates what they want to be able to print, and the software parses the English description
to generate the corresponding G-code instructions [50]. Likewise, the PrintAssist chatbot
lets users control a 3D printer by text: novices use chat commands to search for a model,
slice it, and start a print. Participants noted that using the chatbot was faster than the tradi-
tional SD-card method [51]. These systems effectively translate voice or text commands
into automated slicer actions and build commands, reducing manual setup effort.
Large language model (LLM)-based assistants can also interpret live print data and
adjust parameters on the flight. In a recent experiment, researchers fed layer-by-layer
camera images and print metrics into a GPT-4 agent after each layer [52]. The LLM
analyzed the visual diagnostics to identify defects (e.g., under-extrusion or warping) and
then immediately adjusted printer settings, such as speed, flow rate, or temperature, for
the next layers. This feedback loop significantly improved results by dynamically adjusting
print parameters based on real-time analysis, thereby enhancing print quality and reducing
material waste. In short, the assistant acts as a 3D printing expert that reads the current
state (images, logs) and makes intelligent parameter adjustments to optimize the ongoing
print [52].
4. Applications of AI in 3D Printing
While reviewing the literature gives many case-specific studies, relevant insights
are gained when these are normalized and systematically analyzed across AM processes.
Table 1 summarizes the case studies by methodology, functionality, applications, and out-
comes. When it comes to real-time process optimization, both reinforcement learning
and Gaussian-process active learning have consistently shown their ability to minimize
process defects and reduce material waste, as demonstrated by Dharmadhikari et al. and
Lee et al. [46,53]. In material behavior prediction, data-driven models consistently outper-

form statistical approaches as evidenced by Akbari et al. [45]. In defect detection, Herzog
et al. and Yin et al. highlighted that CNNs, along with YOLO models, achieve detection
accuracies exceeding 90% [54,55]. Automating design processes using generative AI has
minimized design cycles while exhibiting significant structural innovation, as demon-
strated by Dritsas et al. and Koul [56,57]. Continuous melt-pool tracking with adaptive
feedback and predictive analysis enabled by vision- based monitoring helped balance
surface roughness vs. energy efficiency, as demonstrated by Khan et al. [58]. While AI tools
are highly effective, their specific advantages greatly vary by process. For example, ANN
excels in defect detection, regression models in FDM material prediction, and reinforcement
learning in DED/WAAM adaptive control.

4.1. Real-Time Process Optimization
Real-time process optimization in AM utilizes AI to dynamically modify critical print-
ing parameters, such as laser power, printing speed, extrusion rates, and layer thickness.
These modifications guarantee that the production process reliably yields high-quality
components, markedly improving efficiency and dependability [64]. AI-driven adaptive
control systems leverage data from many sensors, including infrared cameras, tempera-
ture sensors, and acoustic monitoring devices, facilitating accurate, real-time feedback for
process regulation [65]. Machine learning and reinforcement learning techniques enable
AM systems to learn from prior prints, facilitating iterative enhancement and reducing
dependence on human involvement [66]. These feedback loops have proven efficient in

minimizing errors, material waste, and manufacturing time, providing significant economic
benefits in industrial environments [67]
Dharmadhikari et al. developed a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-based approach
to optimize AM process parameters, formulating laser power and scan speed adjustments
as interactive learning tasks within a simulated environment; through iterative trial-and-
error interactions, the RL agent autonomously identified parameter combinations that
enhanced part quality and minimized defects and residual stresses, underscoring the
potential of RL algorithms in developing self-correcting, adaptive 3D printing systems [46].
Lee et al. presented an innovative Pareto-active learning framework leveraging
Gaussian-process surrogate modeling for efficient, simultaneous optimization of conflicting
mechanical properties—specifically strength and ductility—in additively manufactured
Ti-6Al-4V alloys; through intelligent selection of experimental points from a candidate
pool, their iterative strategy successfully pinpointed optimal laser powder bed fusion
and post-processing parameters, significantly enhancing the material’s tensile strength
(1190 MPa) and elongation (16.5%), demonstrating active learning’s capacity to streamline
targeted exploration of complex parameter spaces [53].
Rojek et al. employed feed-forward ANNs coupled with optimization algorithms to
refine extrusion-based fused deposition modeling (FDM) process parameters, explicitly
targeting improvements in sustainability, energy efficiency, and print quality; their ANN-
based surrogate models effectively predicted part surface finish and energy consumption,
facilitating parameter adjustments that reduced material waste and optimized overall
manufacturing performance, thereby exemplifying a robust approach to balancing multiple,
often competing, production objectives through machine learning [37].
Process optimization plays a vital role in direct energy deposition (DED) AM process,
as the quality of fabricated parts is dependent on various parameters. Relative importance
index for process parameters like power, speed, feed rate of the laser, and layer thickness
were concluded using MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) by Narayana et al. [68]. Weld process
parameter optimization to obtain a minimum heat affected zone (HAZ) width in gas
metal arc welding (GMAW) was proposed by Mezaache et al. [69]. The particle swarm
optimization algorithm was used to optimize parameters like welding speed, nozzle-to-
plate distance, voltage speed or wire feed speed to achieve minimum HAZ.
In summary, AI-driven optimization in AM encompasses supervised learning (rapid
surrogate models for parameter selection) and reinforcement learning (adaptive control that
learns from the printing process itself). These strategies are resulting in more intelligent
machines that can dynamically adapt to sustain optimal printing conditions and part quality.
4.2. Material Behavior Prediction
Understanding and accurately predicting material properties and behaviors in 3D print-
ing is crucial for achieving consistent and reliable results. AI models—especially machine
learning and deep learning algorithms—can predict various mechanical, thermal, and flow
properties of materials [45]. Machine learning models such as ANNs, support vector machines,
and random forest models can efficiently work with large and complex datasets derived from
experimental tests and simulation results to produce consistent predictions [59]. These ad-
vanced predictions help fine-tune material selection and process parameters, thereby reducing
optimization costs and accelerating the integration of novel materials into manufacturing pro-
cesses [70]. Additionally, AI-driven predictions minimize reliance on empirical trial-and-error
methods, thereby speeding up the overall production process.
In a detailed benchmarking study, Akbari et. al. [45] proposed MechProNet, a machine
learning-based framework specifically designed to predict mechanical properties of metal
additively manufactured components, leveraging a curated dataset extracted from over

90 published sources encompassing diverse process parameters, material properties, and
experimental outcomes; notably, the authors integrate physics-aware feature engineering
and explainable AI techniques, such as SHAP analysis, to enhance interpretability and
demonstrate accurate, cost-effective predictions of critical mechanical attributes, including
yield strength, tensile strength, and hardness, thereby significantly significantly reducing
reliance on extensive empirical testing.
Xie et al. introduced a hybrid mechanistic–data-driven methodology that integrates
wavelet transformations with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to predict location-
specific mechanical properties in metal AM; by systematically analyzing thermal history
data captured during the printing process, their model effectively mapped localized thermal
signatures to spatial variations in mechanical attributes, such as tensile strength, thereby
achieving high predictive accuracy despite limited experimental data and illustrating the
efficacy of domain-specific deep learning in revealing intricate process–structure–property
relationships [59].
A. Ziadia et al. employed ensemble machine learning models to accurately predict
critical mechanical properties—such as ultimate tensile strength, Young’s modulus, and
strain at break—for polymer-based fused filament fabrication (FFF) components made from
PLA and carbon-fiber reinforced PLA, using input parameters like printing temperature,
speed, and layer thickness. The authors further combined their predictive framework with
a genetic algorithm for multi-objective optimization, successfully identifying optimal print
settings (e.g., 222 ◦C printing temperature, 0.26 mm layer thickness) that improved ultimate
tensile strength significantly (~41 MPa). This study highlights the effectiveness of integrat-
ing machine learning and evolutionary algorithms to concurrently model, predict, and
optimize the mechanical performance of additively manufactured polymer composites [60].
A neural network (NN) model was used by Kats et al. to predict grain structure
characteristics in DED [71]. Machine learning networks like XGBoost and LSTM were used
by Zhang et al. to predict melt pool temperature in DED [72]. When it comes to wire arc
additive manufacturing (WAAM), Lv et al. developed a prediction model using ANN [73].
They specifically had a backpropagation artificial neural network (BPANN) model, which
predicted welding penetration. Using this model, they then proposed BPANN-piecewise
(BPANN-PW) controller for real-time control. A multi-input multi-output (MIMO) model
predictive control (MPC) based on linear autoregressive (ARX) modeling was proposed
by Mu et al. for predictive control of bead geometry in WAAM [74]. Real time updates on
weld parameters between successive layers by the MPC controller in addition to measuring
the deposited bead geometry by laser scanner acted as inputs to the ARX model, which in
turn made future bead geometry predictions, enabling real-time control. This methodology
showed a reduction in part height by 400%, in addition to improving fluctuations in bead
width by 50%.
4.3. Defect Detection and Quality Assurance
The involvement of AI in defect detection and quality control has enhanced the re-
liability of AM. Advanced computer vision and sensor fusion techniques are capable of
detecting defects such as porosity, warping, delamination, cracks, and lack of fusion [61].
Studies have demonstrated that deep learning methods—particularly convolutional neural
networks (CNNs)—are highly effective in real-time image processing and defect detec-
tion [75]. Moreover, AI systems are continuously evolving, enhancing their defect detection
capabilities and thereby increasing the adoption of AM in certification-critical industries
such as aerospace and medical [54]. These real-time defect management systems signifi-
cantly reduce the risk of part rejection due to defects or faulty parts reaching the assembly
stage, thus lowering both time and cost.

AI-driven quality control emphasizes the utilization of computer vision and sensor data
to autonomously identify flaws in the printing process Yin et al. [55] created an AI-based
monitoring system for metal powder bed fusion that analyzes layer-wise images using deep
learning. A fresh annotated dataset was constructed, and various CNN architectures were
evaluated for fault recognition. Their findings indicated that ResNet-50 and EfficientNet
models could categorize powder bed images (normal versus defect) with an accuracy over
99%, while the YOLOv5 network was more adept at identifying defect spots (e.g., spatter,
incomplete fusion) compared to the conventional Faster R-CNN method (Figure 3) [54]. This
validates the potential of deep learning in real-time anomaly detection, facilitating prompt
modifications to prevent print failures.
Figure 3. Example of an AI-driven defect detection system for metal laser powder bed fusion. Layer
images are analyzed by classification and object detection models to identify anomalies. In one study,
ResNet-50 and EfficientNet-V2 achieved ~99–100% accuracy in classifying normal vs. defective layers,
while a YOLOv5 detector localized defects with higher mean average precision (81.5%) than a Faster
R-CNN model (46.3%) [55].
In a comprehensive and insightful review, Djenouri et al. critically analyzed recent
advancements in the application of AI, particularly machine learning and computer vi-
sion methodologies, for defect detection in AM; they systematically examined prevalent
evaluation metrics, publicly accessible datasets along with their inherent limitations, and
emphasized key unresolved issues, including data scarcity and challenges associated with
real-time defect inspection [76].
Fu et al. conducted a comprehensive review of machine learning algorithms for defect
detection in laser-based AM. They reported that techniques ranging from support vector
machines to neural networks have been used to recognize defects like porosity, lack of fusion,
and surface anomalies. The consensus is that integrating in situ monitoring with ML models
can significantly improve quality assurance by catching defects early and reducing scrap [77].
DED is prone to defects because of its geometry, pores and cracks, and incomplete
fusion. DED-assisted parts often have a poor surface finish due to incomplete melting
and sputtering, and surface anomaly prediction is gaining traction. A machine learning-

based KNN model with in situ cloud processing was developed by Chen et al., achieving
93.15% accuracy [67]. An self-organizing map with a clustering algorithm was used to
group melt-pool thermal distributions based on similarity for porosity prediction with 96%
accuracy by Chowdhury et al. in DED [78]. Parameters of multipass GMAW by robotic
arms were monitored and datasets were generated for different topologies. Using this data,
four characteristic deviations of welding parameters were acquired and a neural network
was trained to detect defects in a multipass GMAW process by Nele et al. [79]. A new
transfer learning model was proposed by Pan et al. [80], in deep learning, where they used
a non-welding defect dataset, ImageNet, to train a MobileNet model and migrated the Mo-
bileNet model to detect welding defects. The resultant TL-MobileNet model accomplished
96.88% accuracy.
4.4. Automation in Design and AM Workflow
AI significantly enhances automation capabilities in AM design and slicing software.
Optimal structures that meet functional, structural, and esthetic criteria can be created using
AI-supported generative design algorithms [57]. This approach makes structural designs
lighter, more durable, and more material efficient than traditional methods. AI-supported
slicing software can significantly reduce production times and improve part quality by
making complex decisions such as optimal layer thickness, support structure orientation,
and tool path [81]. AI-supported generative design and advanced slicing algorithms can
not only accelerate production processes but also deliver more innovative designs and
improved mechanical strength for parts [82].
In a comprehensive review, Koul [57] examines the integration of AI and machine
learning with generative design methodologies, including topology optimization and
automated shape generation, emphasizing how AI-driven strategies vastly expand the
exploration of design solutions, uncovering innovative, non-intuitive structuresstructures.
Notably, the study highlights the transformative potential of ML-enabled generative ap-
proaches for rapid, scalable customization and iterative design refinement, significantly
accelerating innovation cycles within AM.
Yuan and Moghaddam, demonstrated the applicability of generative adversarial
networks (GANs) for attribute-aware design generation by developing a specialized model
termed “Design-Attribute GAN (DA-GAN),” capable of autonomously synthesizing and
manipulating product shapes based on targeted visual and functional attributes; their
experiments illustrate the versatility of GANs in creating diverse design variants and
systematically modifying existing designs, underscoring the substantial potential for deep
generative models to enhance AM workflows by automating the generation of tailored
structures, such as lattice configurations or advanced metamaterials [62].
Dritsas and Trigka, in a forward-looking perspective, explore the emergent roles of
generative AI technologies—particularly GPT-like and diffusion-based models—in AM, envi-
sioning a future in which textual descriptions seamlessly translate into fully realized printable
models; their analysis indicates nascent but growing adoption of generative AI tools capa-
ble of autonomously proposing and optimizing complex AM designs, including automated
generation of support structures and real-time adjustments during fabrication, marking a
profound evolution toward a highly automated, creativity-driven 3D printing pipeline [56].
Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have emerged as powerful tools in AM,
particularly for real-time defect detection and quality control through advanced image
analysis. Notable examples include the work of Kwon et al., who employed a deep CNN
to classify melt-pool images from metal printing, accurately identifying distinct melt-pool
states directly from camera feeds [63]. Likewise, Yin et al. leveraged CNN architectures
such as ResNet and EfficientNet to achieve near-perfect accuracy in identifying powder

bed defects, while implementing the YOLOv5 object detection model to precisely localize
anomalies during the printing process, illustrating CNNs’ unique ability to autonomously
extract and interpret visual and thermal signatures for continuous monitoring and feedback-
driven process correction [55].
Support vector machines (SVMs) and other classical machine learning classifiers
such as decision trees, k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), and ensemble techniques have shown
considerable utility in AM applications characterized by smaller datasets or when in-
terpretability is critical. For example, Khan et al. combined an ensemble of machine
learners—including SVM, k-NN, and gradient boosting—to predict the flexural strength
of carbon fiber–reinforced printed parts, achieving a notably high coefficient of determi-
nation (R2 ≈0.97) [58]. Additionally, SVMs have demonstrated robustness in classifying
defects and equipment health signals, particularly excelling when working with structured
or limited datasets, thereby underscoring the value of hybridized and interpretable ML
approaches within AM processes.
ANNs, including multi-layer perceptrons, have demonstrated their broad applicabil-
ity and effectiveness across AM tasks involving regression, optimization, and surrogate
modeling. For instance, Rojek et al. successfully utilized a feed-forward ANN to predict
surface roughness and tensile strength in fused deposition modeling (FDM), subsequently
employing this predictive model to optimize printing parameters for improved component
quality [37]. Furthermore, deep ANN architectures have effectively modeled and predicted
complex surface properties in metal additive processes, outperforming traditional empirical
models, highlighting ANNs’ versatility and potential as predictive, adaptive, and surrogate
models in scenarios where the underlying process–structure–property relationships are
highly nonlinear and difficult to capture through conventional methods.
The selection of an AI model is contingent upon the particular difficulty in AM. Vision-
based challenges, such as defect identification, favor convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
and deep learning, whereas predictive analytics for process parameters may employ simpler
machine learning models or ANNs in scenarios of insufficient data. These AI technologies
are enhancing 3D printing by increasing precision, minimizing waste, and expediting
design-to-product timelines.
5. Smart Manufacturing Systems
Production intelligence towards the era of Industry 4.0 indicates a paradigm shift: a
technology-based, environmental responsive interconnected revolution involving intel-
ligent manufacturing, including AI and IoT (Internet of Things) as an integrated digital
twin application [83,84]. In continuation of the fourth Industrial Revolution, this trans-
disciplinary feature of Industry 4.0 has been coined “smart manufacturing”, in which
technology convergence is redefining traditional manufacturing paradigms to create smart
manufacturing systems that can learn autonomously, optimize processes and take cor-
rective action [85–87]. Consequently, manufacturing operations have reached limits of
efficiency, quality and operational flexibility that lead to dynamic responses to changing
market demand and operating conditions [88,89]. Such intelligent systems use real-time
data acquisition and analytics for informed decisions at all production stages [90–93]. The
integration of machines, sensors and enterprise systems through IoT not only enriches
the visibility on the shop floor but also empowers predictive maintenance and process
self-optimization, which in turn minimizes downtime and leads to higher yield.
5.1. Development of Self-Learning, Self-Correcting Systems
At the heart of smart manufacturing are self-learning and self-correcting systems. By
using AI algorithms (especially machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)), these
systems grow better and better over time. Such self-learning systems mine large databases

of data—including sensors, machines, and others—to identify patterns, detect anomalies,
and make predictive decisions [94,95]. For example, a 3D printing system that can learn to
optimize its process parameters based on big data analysis is able to improve print quality
and reduce defect rates [96,97]. Furthermore, expert systems have been embedded with
capacities for self-learning, self-correcting, and expansion, enabling them to easily adjust to
ever-changing industrial environments without the need for updates from knowledge engi-
neers [98]. These enhancements ensure that manufacturing systems maximize productivity
and reliability with minimal oversight [99]. Kumar and Mishra proposed a self-correcting
architectural system capable of generating an excellent manufacturing plan that reduces
the supply chain and production cost In the multi-agent framework, the corporate memory
agent serves as a central knowledge hub, storing all critical information necessary for the
effective execution of manufacturing processes. The manufacturing agent approaches the
task of generating production plans with a portfolio of algorithms and adapts to shifting
market conditions, using a self-reacting capability modeled after the human immune sys-
tem. The forecasting agent automatically selects the most appropriate forecasting method
(judgmental or quantitative) based on input data complexity. Meanwhile, the supplier
selection agent identifies the most appropriate supplier by balancing trade-offs among
factors such as cost, availability, quality, geographical proximity, and reliability.
Henke et al. [100] imparted a novel, infrastructure-free way of implementing auto-
mated guided vehicle (AGV) use. The authors noted that this new structure of logistics
eliminates the need for significant investment in traditional infrastructure, such as universal
warehouses (Figure 4). Rather, they endorsed modular and adaptive systems deployable in
a plug-and-play manner [100,101]. Utilizing these advanced AGVs will enable warehouses
to load, without the need to expand their physical footprint. The vehicles can then calculate
new in-driving logistics routes automatically if there are changes with information about
the load carrier or storage location [102]. The flexibility and intelligence of AGVs allow
them to recursively optimize their paths and operations, making it possible for material
flow within the warehouse to remain smooth and efficient. Thus, innovative AGVs make
the implementation of infrastructure-less logistics advantageous in many ways. Firstly, it
eliminates the need to invest in capital expenditure to establish and maintain traditional
warehouse infrastructure. Secondly, modularity contributes to flexibility and scalability,
meaning warehouses can be expanded or adapted quickly to meet new demands [103].
Thirdly, AGVs operate autonomously with minimal human intervention, increasing pro-
duction line efficiency and reducing labor costs.

Most self-recovering 3D printing systems are closed-loop in architecture and often
combine feedback of multiple types. They monitor process variables continuously and
alter printing parameters automatically to maintain optimal quality. Lu et al. [104] showed
a reinforcement learning method in which their system learned from past printing expe-
riences to achieve a 37% reduction in defect rates compared with open-loop controls. A
novel framework that blends advanced deep learning architectures with robot-based AM
systems was presented in a typical study (Figure 3). The robotic hardware setup shown
in Figure 5a consists of the IRC5 controller, which coordinates the working module of the
robot, and the important parts in the extrusion systems are the fan, motor, heater, print
head, and temperature sensors, responsible for cooling, driving thermoplastic filament,
material feeding, and showing print temperature, respectively (Figure 5b).

Figure 5. The overall hardware setup. (a) robot-based AM system; (b) extrusion interface [104].
Furthermore, the developed methodology allows for real-time defect identification
in CFRP manufacturing, which substantially improves printing accuracy through auto-
matic process parameter adjustment within a closed-loop control system. The proposed
system exhibits strong performance in detecting and classifying two important CFRP defect
families: fiber misalignment (FM) and surface abrasion. Subsequently, quantitative rela-
tionships were reported between the designs of different toolpaths and process parameter
settings and specific defect types, based on thorough experimental inspection. Moreover,
the framework adopts a hybrid analytical strategy by synthesizing CNN classifications
with geometric analysis algorithms to quantify the degree of misalignment and accurately
identify what kind of compensatory actions should be applied. This integrated approach
provides a foundation for autonomous quality control in composite AM systems.
Figure 6 illustrates a novel proprietary software architecture for robot-based AM. It
connects serial and ethernet-based interfaces through temperature control, video monitor-
ing, extrusion parts, and robotic elements. To enhance strategy generation and an in-flight
real-time detection, four modular functions run concurrently. The workflow includes:
on-the-fly path planning with parameterization (hatch size, infill type, contour lines, speed

control, and temperature); synchronized feed rate propagation to the motion controller;
and sending path coordinates to the robot controller. This visual CFRP defect identification
is used to automatically regulate the process parameters, and thereby a closed-loop manu-
facturing system is more responsive, self-correcting during printing to maintain defect-free
print quality.

The term “cognitive manufacturing” refers to systems that are able to interpret com-
prehensive sensor data patterns that manual diagnosis are likely to neglect based on typical
statistical methods, compared with the ability of neural networks, similar to multi-sensor
arrays used by [105,106]. Using an experimental apparatus including thermal, acoustic
and optical sensors, they were able to accurately predict and compensate for dimensional
deviations in 94.2% of instances. Apparently, in self-learning models transfer learning has
come as a savior. For new materials and components, rather than training (almost) from
scratch for every new part to be printed, they are able to generalize what they learned
from prior printing examples. Several studies have made assumptions to characterize
the performance of transfer learning in predicting part quality when changing from one
HP polymer material to another, and have shown that calibration time is 78% faster with
comparable part quality [107–109].
5.2. Integration of AI with IoT and Digital Twins
Smart manufacturing systems also depend on AI integrated with IoT technologies. Sen-
sors, actuators, and connected machines (IoT devices) provides real-time data acquisition
and communication throughout the manufacturing ecosystem [110]. AI-based algorithms
can subsequently analyze this data to learn about machine performance, product qual-
ity, and supply chain efficiency. For example, real-time 3D printing under IoT with AI
can monitor the health of 3D printers and predict maintenance to avoid unexpected fail-
ures [111,112]. The empirical examination offers quantitative results on the transformative
role of IoT-AI integration in Industry 5.0 manufacturing. Rigorous data analysis demon-

strates a statistically significant production efficiency improvement of 1.52%, correlated
with post-implementation environmental modifications, specifically temperature eleva-
tions of 36.2 ◦C and humidity reductions of 44.8% [113]. Quality metrics exhibited marked
enhancement, with fault occurrences decreasing by two instances, corresponding to a 0.76%
elevation in quality assessment scores (93.1). Maintenance time decreased by 2.3 h, while
the impact of unplanned downtime on overall throughput by 52 mi. These data verify the
benefits to operations of IoT–AI symbiosis and thus represent this technological conver-
gence as a cornerstone in the Industry 5.0 era, with visible improvements in productivity,
quality control, and maintenance efficiency.
Smart manufacturing systems also rely on digital twins, virtual replicas of physical
objects or processes. Manufacturers can use this 3D printing digital twin to simulate and op-
timize the entire production cycle before producing the object in real life [110]. Digital twins
may be used to apply AI algorithms to material behavior predictions, issue identification
and design parameter optimization. Physical prototyping then saves time and resources,
this in turns improves the overall quality of the product [114,115]. The major applications
of AI in material systems are summarized in Figure 7, which is divided into four main
fields: material design, process simulation, defect detection and property prediction. AI in
material design also stresses molecular modeling, predictive algorithms and new material
compositions. AI can visualize stress–strain behavior, fluid flow dynamics, and process
parameters optimization by using AI-assisted techniques for process simulation like finite
element modeling (FEM) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). For defect detection,
anomaly detection and automatic inspection systems powered by AI are used to detect
microstructural defects that improve quality control. These processes characterize the
residue via condition monitoring and plant diagnostic methods, followed by application of
AI-based property prediction to approximate mechanical and thermal properties, correlate
properties on a macroscopic scale, and automate material evaluation procedures. Overall,
AI integration makes the development of material a lot easier as it helps to improve design,
simulation, prediction, and defect detection processes.

Gu et al. [117] proposed a new type of distributed physical architecture for smart
factories, named DPASF-IA, using intelligent agents. The architecture is straightforwardly
divided into four functional units named: processing, transportation, storage, and decision-
making. These heterogeneous units are seamlessly integrated by intelligent agents. To im-

prove scheduling efficiency in the smart factory, they propose a data-driven reinforcement-
learning based scheduling algorithm. This enables effective management and optimized
scheduling performance. Figure 8 illustrates the physical architecture of the smart factory,
where IoT using a local area network (LAN) interconnects different types of units with
cloud for transmitting and exchanging information continuously. The architecture consists
of several functional units: the processing unit (including components such as machine
tools, buffers, and manipulators), the transportation unit (e.g., automated guided vehicle
(AGV) trolleys), the storage unit (such as automatic storage and retrieval systems), the
decision-making unit (supervisory control), and the cloud infrastructure.
Figure 8. A proposed physical architecture of a smart factory based on intelligent agent [117].
Under the surface, these various modules conceal a single structural design with an
industrial PC (IPC) inside every system to centralize control and data processing. This
buffer associated with the processing units also serves as a buffer at the transportation des-

tination within the processing unit—thus illustrating an integrated resource management
concept. Similarly, Wang and colleagues present a smart factory architecture by combining
through industrial networks and the cloud with supervisory control terminals as well as
intelligent shop-floor elements supported among machines, conveyors, and products [118].
This framework classifies these smart objects as different types of agents and then sets up a
coordinator in the cloud. The combination of planning flexibility and operation flexibility
(Figure 9) comes from the working level where agents make their own decisions and locally
cooperate as a network. Moreover, this self-organizing system needs external feedback and
control from a central coordinator for optimum efficiency. The processes and agents are
represented as different agent types, and the system can ensure that these diverse tasks are
managed efficiently, thereby enabling each category of smart object able to participate in
achieving the overall operational goals. The central coordinator is responsible for coordi-
nating interactions across all these agents, making sure that they can operate independently
but together to accomplish goals.

Figure 9. Framework for the proposed smart factory of Industry 4.0 [118].
Zhou et al. [21] proposed multi-agent system (MAS) architecture for smart factories
that enhances the learning and scheduling efficiency of multiple AI schedulers, allowing
them to effectively manage low-volume-high-mix orders and adapt to real-time changes
in production conditions, such as rush orders and machine failure. These approaches
pave a new way for cyber-physical integration in smart manufacturing leveraging IoT
technologies to enable seamless communication between manufacturing units (Figure 10).
The solution uses RFID tags to efficiently store and share machining operation details so that
they can be incorporated into a distributed architecture, which substantially improves the
efficiency and reliability of scheduling procedures [93,119]. This near-real-time scheduling
uses these state-of-the-art neural networks built for each individual factory and forms
a core component of the approach. These are real-time AI-enabled schedulers that can
make decisions based on dynamic operations and sensor data to ensure optimal resource
utilization without bottlenecking production [120]. It leverages the collective experience
of one smart AI scheduler learning from another scheduling approach, as well as from

collaboratively learning capabilities, promoting its common sense in a way that contributes
to the overall improvement of performance measures [87,121].

5.3. Case Studies and Current Implementations
AI-driven smart manufacturing systems appear to have transformative potential, as
seen from several well-known case studies in which they revolutionized production pro-
cesses and were the next big step of Industry 4.0 or even 5.0. However, a study conducted
by Dmitrieva et al. [113] revealed that IoT and AI incorporation in smart manufacturing
lines had a substantial impact on production efficiency, quality control, and maintenance
practices. Manufacturers were able to optimize their operations, reduce downtime, and
improve performance through real-time data collected from IoT sensors processed with AI
algorithms for predictive analytics and decision-making. Smart factories, as the automotive
industry has certainly seen, offer huge advantages. Table 2 shows an overview of imple-
mentations of self-learning and AI integrated with digital twins. A comprehensive study
by Sjödin et al. [122] showcased the positive impact of implementing smart manufacturing
systems in automotive production lines.
The improvements in processed productivity, quality and sustainability were sig-
nificant based on the results. For example, new automotive products started to adopt
AI-driven optimization techniques to reduce product flaws and waste via IoT-powered
real-time surveillance, which means that low-cost competition becomes a significant factor,
although only in price rather than technical means [123].
In another, self-learning factory mechanisms were shown to reduce energy consump-
tion and improve customer satisfaction by predicting process plans in advance, with a
success case study carried out in the metal-cutting industry. By incorporating AI algorithms
and IoT sensors, advanced intelligent systems were enabled to self-regulate cutting parame-
ters and tool paths through real-time data analysis. Over the long term, these self-sufficient

factories managed to predict and adapt to changing machining conditions, leading to a
dramatic decrease in energy use while preserving product quality and productivity [124].

6. Industrial Impact and Future Potential
AI-driven 3D printing has enabled great customization, optimization, and efficiency
than before, resulting in shorter production times and reduced costs. These systems
minimized waste by 30% in fused deposition modeling (FDM) printers, according to [125].
AI-driven 3D printers are equipped with sensors that offer predictive maintenance, reducing
downtime, according to Additive manufacturing standards. Recently, it has expanded into
many fields like Aerospace, healthcare, construction, and consumer products, to name
a few. Some of the recent developments of 3D printed manufacturing backed by AI are
highlighted in this section.
6.1. Aerospace
3D printing driven by AI is revolutionizing aerospace production by enabling the
production of complex, lightweight parts that significantly enhance efficiency. A prototype
of a rocket engine made using both 3D printing and AI was revealed by Munich-based
Hyperganic in 2020. After making a lot of progress, they were able to create the world’s
largest 3D-printed rocket engine in partnership with AMCM, an EOS sister company [126].
In another instance, GE Aviation 3D-printed a fuel nozzle for the LEAP engine, which is
25% lighter. They were able to consolidate 20 parts into a single component, which is a
landmark achievement [127]. While GE Aviation’s consolidation of 20 parts into a single,
lighter fuel nozzle is a landmark achievement, publicly available and detailed ROI analyses
remain scarce. However, if put in proper perspective, the reduction in aircraft weight
translates into reduced fuel consumption and costs. This lack of transparent economic data
is a broader challenge in the industry, making it difficult for other companies to build a
business case for similar AI-driven adoption.
6.2. Healthcare
AI-driven 3D printing in healthcare has enabled early disease prediction, personalized
implants and prosthetics, bio-printed tissues, and dental implants, among other appli-
cations. For example, Materialize offers a wide variety of services involving AI-enabled
3D-printed implants based on CT scan data [128]. Additionally, drug toxicity was assessed
on 3D printed liver tissue by Organovo [129]. Three-dimensional printing platforms and
AI-assisted design software also help in the production of personalized dental implants at
Carbon [130].

6.3. Construction
3D printing in construction is undergoing a significant transformation because of
the smart contributions of AI, by automating complex tasks, enabling real-time problem
solving and decision-making, and improving the quality and print design. An AI-driven
mobile robotic printer was used by Apis Cor to construct a home.; they 3D-printed an
entire house in just 24 h in Russia [131]. Three-dimensional printable building models
were generated using AI through NASA’s Mars Habitat Challenge, in which AI optimized
models by analyzing environmental factors [132].
6.4. Consumer Products
Intelligent manufacturing is altering the consumer product landscape by mass per-
sonalization, rapid prototyping, and on-demand production. Its analytical tools include
behavioral prediction, forecasting demand, and sensors, to name a few. Personalized
ergonomic gaming accessories were made by IKEA in collaboration with UNYQ using AI
and 3D printing [133]. AI algorithms at Gilette streamline the design to 3D print handles
for their razors [134].
The incorporation of AI in 3D printing has transformed product development, from
design optimization to real-time control, enhancing productivity and reducing costs. The
era of intelligent manufacturing is in its beginning stages, but fast progress is giving way
for a future where AM becomes faster and smarter. The days of print farms being cloud-
connected, allowing thousands of machines to work simultaneously, are not too far away.
AI-supported life cycle analysis (LCA) will help make better material and geometry choices.
New user interfaces might emerge with the help of AI, making 3D printing more accessible.
With ongoing research and development, AI will transform the initial 3D printing into a
fully integrated, intelligent system.
7. Data Governance, Adaptability, and Standards
As AI-driven AM gains popularity and widespread use, we will face challenges
beyond performance and control, including data governance, adaptability, and regulatory
compliance. AI models are trained using previous datasets, such as process logs, feed data,
and design data. Sharing these datasets might raise concerns about intellectual property,
privacy, and cyber security. Another barrier at the industry level is that a model may not be
automatically generalizable beyond the data it was trained on. A model trained to detect
wear on one machine may not be able to do the same on a different machine, because of
the variations between machines. In addition to these, AI-enabled AM must comply with
regulatory standards like ISO/ASTM 52904 [135]. When using AI in AM in highly regulated
fields like medical or aviation, the builds must meet FDA and FAA requirements. Without
meeting these criteria, AI might be confined to experimental applications. Transparent data
policies, transferability in learning strategies, and compliance with global standards will
accelerate the use of AI in AM.
8. Conclusions
AI is transforming 3D printing through smart automation, defect detection, and
optimized production. Technologies like machine learning, deep learning, and computer
vision are making 3D printing faster, more accurate, and more adaptable. However,
significant challenges still exist. The ‘black-box’ nature of many deep learning models
limits their use in safety-critical applications where explainability is essential. Data scarcity,
particularly for rare defect types, reduces the ability of predictive models to generalize
across different machines and materials. Additionally, the high computational and financial
costs of deploying advanced AI systems create a major obstacle to widespread industry

adoption. Future research should focus on developing physics-informed AI, establishing
standardized validation datasets, and advancing explainable AI to build the trust and
reliability necessary for mission-critical manufacturing.
However, despite these advances, several challenges remain, including data scarcity,
limited generalizability across printers and materials, certification barriers in safety-critical
industries, computational costs for real-time deployment, and the need for explainable AI.
Addressing these challenges presents significant opportunities for future research.
Developing standardized datasets, physics-informed AI models, efficient algorithms, and
human-in-the-loop systems will be essential to fully realize the potential of AI in AM.
Indeed, when these solutions reach maturity, there is a potential for additive manufacturing
with AI to be not only a supplementary tool but the heart of innovative production systems.
Such a transition would, besides benefiting the company with increased effectiveness
and dependability, also allow for design possibilities and sustainability initiatives that
are beyond the capability of traditional methods. By overcoming these hurdles, AI can
transform AM into a more reliable, sustainable, and intelligent production paradigm,
unlocking new possibilities in design, production, and quality assurance, and accelerating
the adoption of Industry 4.0/5.0 principles across manufacturing sectors.
